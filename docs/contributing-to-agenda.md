## Contributing to Meetings

### Prepare Content

- Well ahead of the MFWG plenary meeting, produce and publish documentation about your proposal/idea, slides, design document, Github issue or any other relevant material, to be shared beforehand and presented during the meeting.

### Getting on the agenda

To propose a presentation/ time slot in MFWG plenary meetings:

- If there is not already an issue describing your topic, create one.
  > Include all relevant information about the topic including necessary documentation.
- Add the label `Agenda+` to the issue.

- Write to the [group email](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/message-format-wg) asking the chair to add your item to the agenda _at least_ 48 hours in advance of the next call. More time is better. Note that the chair may choose to defer your item until a later meeting or to "future". Be sure to indicate any time restrictions you have.
- Watch for the chair to update the [official agenda](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/wiki).
  - Notes for each meeting can be found by date under [this link](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/tree/main/meetings)
