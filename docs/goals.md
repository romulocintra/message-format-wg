# Goals and Non-Goals

This document defines the purpose of the Message Format Working Group (MFWG)
and informs the decisions about the scope and the priorities of its efforts.

## Goals

The primary task of the MFWG is to develop an industry standard for the
representation of localizable dynamic message strings. A **_dynamic message
string_** is a string whose content changes due to the value of or insertion
of some data value or values.

The design goals are listed below.

1.  Express grammatical features, such as plurals, genders, and inflections.

2.  Express other variance in translation, due to linguistic and regional
    features, the presentation media, context, circumstance, and other factors.

3.  Express formattable data, such as numbers, dates, currencies, or units,
    in a locale-appropriate way.

4.  Represent structured data alongside translations, such as markup, comments,
    and metadata.

5.  Be capable of localization roundtrip.

6.  Enable the creation of implementations, frameworks and tools building on
    top of the standard, manifesting different ideas and programming paradigms,
    and optimized for different uses and audiences.

## Deliverables

1.  A formal definition of the canonical data model for representing
    localizable _dynamic message strings_.

2.  A formal definition of the canonical syntax for representing the data
    model, with well defined rules for handling text, special characters,
    escape sequences, whitespace, markup, as well as parsing errors.

3.  A specification for a one-to-one mapping between the data model and XLIFF.
    _Note that this deliverable is "at risk" and not expected to be part of the
    2023 fall release._

4.  A specification for resolving messages at runtime, including
    interpolated data types and runtime errors.

5.  A conformance test suite for parsing and formatting messages sufficient to
    ensure implementations can validate conformance to the specification(s) provided.

6.  A determination that there are at least two interoperable independent implementations
    compliant with the conformance test suite in order to demonstrate that the
    specification(s) are practical and meet requirements.

## Non-Goals

The following is a list of potential goals which are explicitly excluded from
the scope of the MFWG.

1.  Design a _general interchange format_ for storing and transferring
    translations. Instead, ensure compatibility with the existing interchange
    formats.

2.  Support _all grammatical features of all languages_. Instead, focus on
    features most commonly encountered in user interfaces, textual, graphical
    and spoken ones alike.

3.  Create an _automated engine_ capable of transforming parts of speech in
    a grammatically-correct fashion. Instead, allow interfacing with such
    automatic and non-automatic engines from within the data model.

4.  Build a _framework for localizing software_. Instead, design the standard
    as a building block to be used by third parties to create localization
    frameworks.
