# WIP DRAFT MessageFormat 2.0 Formatting Behaviour

## Introduction

This document defines the behaviour of a MessageFormat 2.0 implementation
when formatting a message for display in a user interface, or for some later processing.

The document is part of the MessageFormat 2.0 specification,
the successor to ICU MessageFormat, henceforth called ICU MessageFormat 1.0.

## Variable Resolution

To resolve the value of a Variable,
its Name is used to identify either a local variable,
or a variable defined elsewhere.
If a local variable and an externally defined one use the same name,
the local variable takes precedence.

It is an error for a local variable definition to
refer to a local variable that's defined after it in the message.
