# WIP DRAFT MessageFormat 2.0 Formatting Behaviour

## Introduction

This document defines the behaviour of a MessageFormat 2.0 implementation
when formatting a message for display in a user interface, or for some later processing.

The document is part of the MessageFormat 2.0 specification,
the successor to ICU MessageFormat, henceforth called ICU MessageFormat 1.0.

## Literal Resolution

The resolved value of _text_, _literal_ and _nmtoken_ tokens
is always a string concatenation of its parts,
with escape sequences resolving to their escaped characters.
When a _literal_ or _nmtoken_ is used as an _expression_ argument
or on the right-hand side of an _option_,
the formatting function MUST treat their resolved values the same independently of their presentation,
such that e.g. the options `foo=42` and `foo=|42|` have the same effect.

## Variable Resolution

To resolve the value of a _variable_,
its _name_ is used to identify either a local variable,
or a variable defined elsewhere.
If a local variable and an externally defined one use the same name,
the local variable takes precedence.

It is an error for a local variable definition to
refer to a local variable that's defined after it in the message.

## Pattern Selection

When formatting a message with one or more _selectors_,
the _pattern_ of one of the _variants_ must be selected for formatting.

When a message has a single _selector_,
an implementation-defined method compares each key to the _selector_
and determines which of the keys match, and in what order of preference.
The list of keys passed to this implementation-defined method
does not include the catch-all key `*`.
The catch-all key `*` is treated as a match for any _selector_,
but with the lowest possible preference.

In a message with more than one _selector_,
the number of keys in each _variant_ **_must_** equal the number of _selectors_.
These correspond to _selectors_ by position.
The same implementation-defined method as above is used to compare
the corresponding key of each _variant_ to its _selector_,
to determine which of the keys match, and in what order of preference.
In order to select a single _variant_,
the full list of _variants_ will need to be filtered and sorted.
First, each _variant_ with a key that does not match its _selector_ is left out.
Then, the remaining _variants_ are sorted lexicographically by key preference,
with earlier _selectors_ having higher priority than later ones.
Finally, the highest-sorted _variant_ is selected.

This selection method is defined in more detail below.
An implementation MAY use any pattern selection method,
as long as its observable behaviour matches the results of the method defined here.

### Resolve Selectors

First, resolve the values of each _selector_:

1. Let `res` be a new empty list of resolved values that support selection.
1. For each _expression_ `exp` of the message's _selectors_,
   1. Let `rv` be the resolved value of `exp`.
   1. If selection is supported for `rv`:
      1. Append `rv` as the last element of the list `res`.
   1. Else:
      1. Let `nomatch` be a resolved value for which selection always fails.
      1. Append `nomatch` as the last element of the list `res`.
      1. Emit a Selection Error.

The shape of the resolved values is determined by each implementation,
along with the manner of determining their support for selection.

### Resolve Preferences

Next, using `res`, resolve the preferential order for all message keys:

1. Let `pref` be a new empty list of lists of strings.
1. For each index `i` in `res`:
   1. Let `keys` be a new empty list of strings.
   1. For each _variant_ `var` of the message:
      1. Let `key` be the `var` key at position `i`.
      1. If `key` is not the catch-all key `'*'`:
         1. Assert that `key` is a _literal_.
         1. Let `ks` be the resolved value of `key`.
         1. Append `ks` as the last element of the list `keys`.
   1. Let `rv` be the resolved value at index `i` of `res`.
   1. Let `matches` be the result of calling the method MatchSelectorKeys(`rv`, `keys`)
   1. Append `matches` as the last element of the list `pref`.

The method MatchSelectorKeys is determined by the implementation.
It takes as arguments a resolved _selector_ value `rv` and a list of string keys `keys`,
and returns a list of string keys in preferential order.
The returned list must only contain unique elements of the input list `keys`,
and it may be empty.
The most preferred key is first, with the rest sorted by decreasing preference.

### Filter Variants

Then, using the preferential key orders `pref`,
filter the list of _variants_ to the ones that match with some preference:

1. Let `vars` be a new empty list of _variants_.
1. For each _variant_ `var` of the message:
   1. For each index `i` in `pref`:
      1. Let `key` be the `var` key at position `i`.
      1. If `key` is the catch-all key `'*'`:
         1. Continue the inner loop on `pref`.
      1. Assert that `key` is a _literal_.
      1. Let `ks` be the resolved value of `key`.
      1. Let `matches` be the list of strings at index `i` of `pref`.
      1. If `matches` includes `ks`:
         1. Continue the inner loop on `pref`.
      1. Else:
         1. Continue the outer loop on message _variants_.
   1. Append `var` as the last element of the list `vars`.

### Sort Variants

Finally, sort the list of variants `vars` and select the _pattern_:

1. Let `sortable` be a new empty list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
1. For each _variant_ `var` of `vars`:
   1. Let `tuple` be a new tuple (-1, `var`).
   1. Append `tuple` as the last element of the list `sortable`.
1. Let `len` be the integer count of items in `pref`.
1. Let `i` be `len` - 1.
1. While `i` >= 0:
   1. Let `matches` be the list of strings at index `i` of `pref`.
   1. Let `minpref` be the integer count of items in `matches`.
   1. For each tuple `tuple` of `sortable`:
      1. Let `matchpref` be an integer with the value `minpref`.
      1. Let `key` be the `tuple` _variant_ key at position `i`.
      1. If `key` is not the catch-all key `'*'`:
         1. Assert that `key` is a _literal_.
         1. Let `ks` be the resolved value of `key`.
         1. Let `matchpref` be the integer position of `ks` in `matches`.
      1. Set the `tuple` integer value as `matchpref`.
   1. Set `sortable` to be the result of calling the method `SortVariants(sortable)`.
   1. Set `i` to be `i` - 1.
1. Let `var` be the _variant_ element of the first element of `sortable`.
1. Select the _pattern_ of `var`.

`SortVariants` is a method whose single argument is
a list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
It returns a list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
Any implementation of `SortVariants` is acceptable
as long as it satisfies the following requirements:

1. Let `sortable` be an arbitrary list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
1. Let `sorted` be `SortVariants(sortable)`.
1. `sorted` is the result of sorting `sortable` using the following comparator:
   1. `(i1, v1)` <= `(i2, v2)` if and only if `i1 <= i2`.
1. The sort is stable (pairs of tuples from `sortable` that are equal
   in their first element have the same relative order in `sorted`).

### Examples

_This section is non-normative._

#### Example 1

Presuming a minimal implementation which only supports string values
and matches keys by using string comparison,
and a formatting context in which
the variable reference `$foo` resolves to the string `'foo'` and
the variable reference `$bar` resolves to the string `'bar'`,
pattern selection proceeds as follows for this message:

```
match {$foo} {$bar}
when bar bar {All bar}
when foo foo {All foo}
when * * {Otherwise}
```

1. For the first selector:<br>
   The value of the selector is resolved to be `'foo'`.<br>
   The available keys « `'bar'`, `'foo'` » are compared to `'foo'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'foo'` » of matching keys.

2. For the second selector:<br>
   The value of the selector is resolved to be `'bar'`.<br>
   The available keys « `'bar'`, `'foo'` » are compared to `'bar'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'bar'` » of matching keys.

3. Creating the list `vars` of variants matching all keys:<br>
   The first variant `bar bar` is discarded as its first key does not match the first selector.<br>
   The second variant `foo foo` is discarded as its second key does not match the second selector.<br>
   The catch-all keys of the third variant `* *` always match, and this is added to `vars`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `* *` » of variants.

4. As the list `vars` only has one entry, it does not need to be sorted.<br>
   The pattern `{Otherwise}` of the third variant is selected.

#### Example 2

Alternatively, with the same implementation and formatting context as in Example 1,
pattern selection would proceed as follows for this message:

```
match {$foo} {$bar}
when * bar {Any and bar}
when foo * {Foo and any}
when foo bar {Foo and bar}
when * * {Otherwise}
```

1. For the first selector:<br>
   The value of the selector is resolved to be `'foo'`.<br>
   The available keys « `'foo'` » are compared to `'foo'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'foo'` » of matching keys.

2. For the second selector:<br>
   The value of the selector is resolved to be `'bar'`.<br>
   The available keys « `'bar'` » are compared to `'bar'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'bar'` » of matching keys.

3. Creating the list `vars` of variants matching all keys:<br>
   The keys of all variants either match each selector exactly, or via the catch-all key,<br>
   resulting in a list « `* bar`, `foo *`, `foo bar`, `* *` » of variants.

4. Sorting the variants:<br>
   The list `sortable` is first set with the variants in their source order
   and scores determined by the second selector:<br>
   « ( 0, `* bar` ), ( 1, `foo *` ), ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 1, `* *` ) »<br>
   This is then sorted as:<br>
   « ( 0, `* bar` ), ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 1, `foo *` ), ( 1, `* *` ) ».<br>
   To sort according to the first selector, the scores are updated to:<br>
   « ( 1, `* bar` ), ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 0, `foo *` ), ( 1, `* *` ) ».<br>
   This is then sorted as:<br>
   « ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 0, `foo *` ), ( 1, `* bar` ), ( 1, `* *` ) ».<br>

5. The pattern `{Foo and bar}` of the most preferred `foo bar` variant is selected.

#### Example 3

Presuming a more powerful implementation which supports selection on numerical values,
and provides a `:plural` function that matches keys by their exact value
as well as their plural category (preferring the former, if possible),
and an English-language formatting context in which
the variable reference `$count` resolves to the number `1`,
pattern selection proceeds as follows for this message:

```
match {$count :plural}
when one {Category match}
when 1 {Exact match}
when * {Other match}
```

1. For the selector:<br>
   The value of the selector is resolved to an implementation-defined value
   that is capable of performing English plural category selection on the value `1`.<br>
   The available keys « `'one'`, `'1'` » are passed to
   the implementation's MatchSelectorKeys method,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'1'`, `'one'` » of matching keys.

2. Creating the list `vars` of variants matching all keys:<br>
   The keys of all variants are included in the list of matching keys, or use the catch-all key,<br>
   resulting in a list « `one`, `1`, `*` » of variants.

3. Sorting the variants:<br>
   The list `sortable` is first set with the variants in their source order
   and scores determined by the selector key order:<br>
   « ( 1, `one` ), ( 0, `1` ), ( 2, `*` ) »<br>
   This is then sorted as:<br>
   « ( 0, `1` ), ( 1, `one` ), ( 2, `*` ) »<br>

4. The pattern `{Exact match}` of the most preferred `1` variant is selected.

## Handling Bidirectional Text

_Messages_ contain text which can be bidirectional, that is
consisting of a mixture of left-to-right and right-to-left spans of text.

When concatenating formatted values,
the [Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/) [UAX9]
can produce unexpected or undesirable effects, such as "spillover".
Formatted values SHOULD be bidirectionally isolated
so that the directionality of a formatted _expression_
does not negatively affect the presentation of the overall formatted result.

An implementation MUST define methods for
determining the directionality of the message as a whole as well as each formatted _expression_.
The method of determining the directionality of a formatted _expression_
MAY rely on the introspection of its contents, or on other means.

If a formatted _expression_ itself contains spans with differing directionality,
its formatter SHOULD isolate such parts to avoid
negatively affecting the presentation of the overall formatted result.

> For example, an implementation could provide a `:number` formatting function
> which would always produce output matching the message's locale,
> allowing for its formatted string representation to never need isolation.

Implementations formatting messages as a concatenated string or a sequence of strings
MUST provide one or more strategies for bidirectional isolation.
One such strategy MUST behave as follows:

1. Let `msgdir` be the directionality of the whole message,
   one of « `'LTR'`, `'RTL'`, `'unknown'` ».
   These correspond to the message having left-to-right directionality,
   right-to-left directionality, and to the message's directionality not being known.
1. For each _expression_ `exp` in _pattern_:
   1. Let `fmt` be the formatted string representation of the resolved value of `exp`.
   1. Let `dir` be the directionality of `fmt`,
      one of « `'LTR'`, `'RTL'`, `'unknown'` », with the same meanings as for `msgdir`.
   1. If `dir` is `'unknown'`:
      1. In the formatted output,
         prefix `fmt` with U+2068 FIRST STRONG ISOLATE
         and postfix it with U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE.
   1. Else, if `dir` is `'LTR'` and `msgdir` is not `'LTR'`:
      1. In the formatted output,
         prefix `fmt` with U+2066 LEFT-TO-RIGHT ISOLATE
         and postfix it with U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE.
   1. Else, if `dir` is `'RTL'` and `msgdir` is not `'RTL'`:
      1. In the formatted output,
         prefix `fmt` with U+2067 RIGHT-TO-LEFT ISOLATE
         and postfix it with U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE.

Alternatives to this "compatibility" strategy MAY be provided by implementations,
which MAY also introspect the _pattern_'s _text_ values
and identify situations where isolate characters are not needed
or where additional or different isolation would produce better results.

If an implementation provides formatting to non-string targets,
it SHOULD provide similar strategies for enabling bidirectional isolation,
where appropriate.

## Error Handling

Errors in messages and their formatting may occur and be detected
at multiple different stages of their processing.
Where available,
the use of validation tools is recommended,
as early detection of errors makes their correction easier.

During the formatting of a message,
various errors may be encountered.
These are divided into the following categories:

- **Syntax errors** occur when the syntax representation of a message is not well-formed.

  > Example invalid messages resulting in a Syntax error:
  >
  > ```
  > {Missing end brace
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > {Unknown {{expression}}}
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > let $var = {|no message body|}
  > ```

- **Data Model errors** occur when a message is invalid due to
  violating one of the semantic requirements on its structure:

  - **Variant Key Mismatch errors** occur when the number of keys on a _variant_
    does not equal the number of _selectors_.

    > Example invalid messages resulting in a Variant Key Mismatch error:
    >
    > ```
    > match {$one}
    > when 1 2 {Too many}
    > when * {Otherwise}
    > ```
    >
    > ```
    > match {$one} {$two}
    > when 1 2 {Two keys}
    > when * {Missing a key}
    > when * * {Otherwise}
    > ```

  - **Missing Fallback Variant errors** occur when the message
    does not include a _variant_ with only catch-all keys.

    > Example invalid messages resulting in a Missing Fallback Variant error:
    >
    > ```
    > match {$one}
    > when 1 {Value is one}
    > when 2 {Value is two}
    > ```
    >
    > ```
    > match {$one} {$two}
    > when 1 * {First is one}
    > when * 1 {Second is one}
    > ```

- **Resolution errors** occur when the runtime value of a part of a message
  cannot be determined.

  - **Unresolved Variable errors** occur when a variable reference cannot be resolved.

    > For example, attempting to format either of the following messages
    > must result in an Unresolved Variable error if done within a context that
    > does not provide for the variable reference `$var` to be successfully resolved:
    >
    > ```
    > {The value is {$var}.}
    > ```
    >
    > ```
    > match {$var}
    > when 1 {The value is one.}
    > when * {The value is not one.}
    > ```

  - **Unknown Function errors** occur when an _expression_ includes
    a reference to a function which cannot be resolved.

    > For example, attempting to format either of the following messages
    > must result in an Unknown Function error if done within a context that
    > does not provide for the function `:func` to be successfully resolved:
    >
    > ```
    > {The value is {horse :func}.}
    > ```
    >
    > ```
    > match {|horse| :func}
    > when 1 {The value is one.}
    > when * {The value is not one.}
    > ```

- **Selection errors** occur when message selection fails.

  - **Selector errors** are failures in the matching of a key to a specific selector.

    > For example, attempting to format either of the following messages
    > might result in a Selector error if done within a context that
    > uses a `:plural` selector function which requires its input to be numeric:
    >
    > ```
    > match {|horse| :plural}
    > when 1 {The value is one.}
    > when * {The value is not one.}
    > ```
    >
    > ```
    > let $sel = {|horse| :plural}
    > match {$sel}
    > when 1 {The value is one.}
    > when * {The value is not one.}
    > ```

- **Formatting errors** occur during the formatting of a resolved value,
  for example when encountering a value with an unsupported type
  or an internally inconsistent set of options.

  > For example, attempting to format any of the following messages
  > might result in a Formatting error if done within a context that
  >
  > 1. provides for the variable reference `$user` to resolve to
  >    an object `{ name: 'Kat', id: 1234 }`,
  > 2. provides for the variable reference `$field` to resolve to
  >    a string `'address'`, and
  > 3. uses a `:get` formatting function which requires its argument to be an object and
  >    an option `field` to be provided with a string value,
  >
  > ```
  > {Hello, {horse :get field=name}!}
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > {Hello, {$user :get}!}
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > let $id = {$user :get field=id}
  > {Hello, {$id :get field=name}!}
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > {Your {$field} is {$id :get field=$field}}
  > ```

Syntax and Data Model errors must be emitted as soon as possible.

During selection, an _expression_ handler must only emit Resolution and Selection errors.
During formatting, an _expression_ handler must only emit Resolution and Formatting errors.

In all cases, when encountering an error,
a message formatter must provide some representation of the message.
An informative error or errors must also be separately provided.
When a message contains more than one error,
or contains some error which leads to further errors,
an implementation which does not emit all of the errors
should prioritise Syntax and Data Model errors over others.

When an error occurs in the resolution of an _expression_,
the _expression_ in question is processed as if the option were not defined.
This may allow for the fallback handling described below to be avoided,
though an error must still be emitted.

When an error occurs within a _selector_,
the _selector_ must not match any _variant_ _key_ other than the catch-all `*`
and a Resolution or Selector error is emitted.

## Fallback String Representations

The formatted string representation of a message with a Syntax or Data Model error
is the concatenation of U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET `{`,
a fallback string,
and U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET `}`.
If a fallback string is not defined,
the U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER `�` character is used,
resulting in the string `{�}`.

When an error occurs in an _expression_ that is being formatted,
the fallback string representation of the _expression_
always starts with U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET `{`
and ends with U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET `}`.
Between the brackets, the following contents are used:

- _expression_ with _literal_ operand: U+007C VERTICAL LINE `|`
  followed by the value of the Literal,
  and then by U+007C VERTICAL LINE `|`

  > Examples: `{|your horse|}`, `{|42|}`

- _expression_ with _variable_ operand: U+0024 DOLLAR SIGN `$`
  followed by the _variable_ _name_ of the operand

  > Example: `{$user}`

- Standalone _expression_ with no operand:
  U+003A COLON `:` followed by the _function_ _name_

  > Example: `{:platform}`

- Opening _expression_ with no operand:
  U+002B PLUS SIGN `+` followed by the _function_ _name_

  > Example: `{+tag}`

- Closing _expression_ with no operand:
  U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS `-` followed by the _function_ _name_

  > Example: `{-tag}`

- Otherwise: The U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER `�` character

  > Example: `{�}`

_Option_ names and values are not included in the fallback string representations.

When an error occurs in an _expression_ with a _variable_ operand
and the _variable_ refers to a local _declaration_,
the fallback string is formatted based on the _expression_ of the _declaration_,
rather than the _expression_ in the _selector_ or _pattern_.

> For example, attempting to format either of the following messages within a context that
> does not provide for the function `:func` to be successfully resolved:
>
> ```
> let $var = {|horse| :func}
> {The value is {$var}.}
> ```
>
> ```
> let $var = {|horse|}
> {The value is {$var :func}.}
> ```
>
> would result in both cases with this formatted string representation:
>
> ```
> The value is {|horse|}.
> ```
