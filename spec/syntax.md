### Introduction

This section defines the formal grammar describing the syntax of a single message.

### Design Goals

_This section is non-normative._

The design goals of the syntax specification are as follows:

1. The syntax should leverage the familiarity with ICU MessageFormat 1.0
   in order to lower the barrier to entry and increase the chance of adoption.
   At the same time,
   the syntax should fix the [pain points of ICU MessageFormat 1.0](../docs/why_mf_next.md).

   - _Non-Goal_: Be backwards-compatible with the ICU MessageFormat 1.0 syntax.

1. The syntax inside translatable content should be easy to understand for humans.
   This includes making it clear which parts of the message body _are_ translatable content,
   which parts inside it are placeholders for expressions,
   as well as making the selection logic predictable and easy to reason about.

   - _Non-Goal_: Make the syntax intuitive enough for non-technical translators to hand-edit.
     Instead, we assume that most translators will work with MessageFormat 2
     by means of GUI tooling, CAT workbenches etc.

1. The syntax surrounding translatable content should be easy to write and edit
   for developers, localization engineers, and easy to parse by machines.

1. The syntax should make a single message easily embeddable inside many container formats:
   `.properties`, YAML, XML, inlined as string literals in programming languages, etc.
   This includes a future _MessageResource_ specification.

   - _Non-Goal_: Support unnecessary escape sequences, which would theirselves require
     additional escaping when embedded. Instead, we tolerate direct use of nearly all
     characters (including line breaks, control characters, etc.) and rely upon escaping
     in those outer formats to aid human comprehension (e.g., depending upon container
     format, a U+000A LINE FEED might be represented as `\n`, `\012`, `\x0A`, `\u000A`,
     `\U0000000A`, `&#xA;`, `&NewLine;`, `%0A`, `<LF>`, or something else entirely).

### Design Restrictions

_This section is non-normative._

The syntax specification takes into account the following design restrictions:

1. Whitespace outside the translatable content should be insignificant.
   It should be possible to define a message entirely on a single line with no ambiguity,
   as well as to format it over multiple lines for clarity.

1. The syntax should define as few special characters and sigils as possible.
   Note that this necessitates extra care when presenting messages for human consumption,
   because they may contain invisible characters such as U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE,
   control characters such as U+0000 NULL and U+0009 TAB, permanently reserved noncharacters
   (U+FDD0 through U+FDEF and U+<i>n</i>FFFE and U+<i>n</i>FFFF where <i>n</i> is 0x0 through 0x10),
   private-use code points (U+E000 through U+F8FF, U+F0000 through U+FFFFD, and
   U+100000 through U+10FFFD), unassigned code points, and other potentially confusing content.

## Overview & Examples

### Messages and Patterns

A **_message_** is the complete template for a specific message formatting request.

All _messages_ MUST contain a _body_.
The _body_ of a _message_ consists of either a _pattern_ or of _selectors_. 
An empty string is not a _well-formed_ _message_.

A _message_ MAY also contain one or more _declarations_ before the _body_.

A **_pattern_** is a sequence of _text_ and _placeholders_ 
to be formatted as a unit.
All _patterns_, including simple ones, begin with U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET `{` 
and end with U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET `}`.

> A _message_ consisting of a simple _pattern_:
>```
>{Hello, world!}
>```

>The same _message_ defined in a `.properties` file:
>
>```properties
>app.greetings.hello = {Hello, world!}
>```

>The same _message_ defined inline in JavaScript:
>
>```js
>let hello = new MessageFormat('{Hello, world!}')
>hello.format()
>```

### Expression

An **_expression_** is a part of a _message_ that will be determined
during the _message_'s formatting.

A **_placeholder_** is an _expression_ that appears inside of a _pattern_
and which will be replaced during the formatting of the _message_.

An _expression_ begins with U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET `{` 
and ends with U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET `}`.

An _expression_ can appear as a local variable value, as a _selector_, and within a _pattern_.

> A simple _expression_ containing a variable:
>
>```
>{Hello, {$userName}!}
>```

### Function

A **_function_** is a named modifier in an _expression_.
A _function_ MAY be followed by zero or more _options_

>For example, a _message_ with a `$date` _variable_ formatted with the `:datetime` _function_:
>
>```
>{Today is {$date :datetime weekday=long}.}
>```

>A _message_ with a `$userName` _variable_ formatted with
>the custom `:person` _function_ capable of
>declension (using either a fixed dictionary, algorithmic declension, ML, etc.):
>
>```
>{Hello, {$userName :person case=vocative}!}
>```

>A _message_ with a `$userObj` _variable_ formatted with
>the custom `:person` _function_ capable of
>plucking the first name from the object representing a person:
>
>```
>{Hello, {$userObj :person firstName=long}!}
>```

_Functions_ can be _standalone_, or can be an _opening element_ or _closing element_.

A **_standalone_** _function_ is not expected to be paired with another _function_.
An **_opening element_** is a _function_ that SHOULD be paired with a _closing function_.
A **_closing element_** is a _function_ that SHOULD be paired with an _opening function_.

An _opening element_ MAY be present in a message without a corresponding _closing element_,
and vice versa.

>A message with two markup-like _functions_, `button` and `link`,
>which the runtime can use to construct a document tree structure for a UI framework:
>
>```
>{{+button}Submit{-button} or {+link}cancel{-link}.}
>```


### Selection

A **_selector_** selects a specific _pattern_ from a list of available _patterns_
in a _message_ based on the value of its _expression_.
A message can have multiple selectors.

>A message with a single _selector_, `{$count :number}`. `:number` is a built-in function. 
>
>```
>match {$count :number}
>when 1 {You have one notification.}
>when * {You have {$count} notifications.}
>```

>A message with a single _selector_ which is an invocation of
>a custom function `:platform`, formatted on a single line:
>
>```
>match {:platform} when windows {Settings} when * {Preferences}
>```

>A message with a single _selector_ and a custom `:hasCase` function
>which allows the message to query for presence of grammatical cases required for each variant:
>
>```
>match {$userName :hasCase}
>when vocative {Hello, {$userName :person case=vocative}!}
>when accusative {Please welcome {$userName :person case=accusative}!}
>when * {Hello!}
>```

>A message with two _selectors_:
>
>```
>match {$photoCount :number} {$userGender :equals}
>when 1 masculine {{$userName} added a new photo to his album.}
>when 1 feminine  {{$userName} added a new photo to her album.}
>when 1 *         {{$userName} added a new photo to their album.}
>when * masculine {{$userName} added {$photoCount} photos to his album.}
>when * feminine  {{$userName} added {$photoCount} photos to her album.}
>when * *         {{$userName} added {$photoCount} photos to their album.}
>```

### Local Variables

A _message_ can define local variables using a _declaration_.
A local variable might be needed for transforming input
or providing additional data to an _expression_.
Local variables appear in a _declaration_,
which defines the value of a named local variable.

>A _message_ containing a _declaration_ defining a local variable `$whom`
>which is then used twice inside the pattern:
>
>```
>let $whom = {$monster :noun case=accusative}
>{You see {$quality :adjective article=indefinite accord=$whom} {$whom}!}
>```

>A _message_ defining two local variables:
>`$itemAcc` and `$countInt`, and using `$countInt` as a selector:
>
>```
>let $countInt = {$count :number maximumFractionDigits=0}
>let $itemAcc = {$item :noun count=$count case=accusative}
>match {$countInt}
>when one {You bought {$color :adjective article=indefinite accord=$itemAcc} {$itemAcc}.}
>when * {You bought {$countInt} {$color :adjective accord=$itemAcc} {$itemAcc}.}
>```

### Complex Messages

The various features can be used to produce arbitrarily complex _messages_ by combining
_declarations_, _selectors_, _functions_, and more.

>A complex message with 2 _selectors_ and 3 local variable _declarations_:
>
>```
>let $hostName = {$host :person firstName=long}
>let $guestName = {$guest :person firstName=long}
>let $guestsOther = {$guestCount :number offset=1}
>
>match {$host :gender} {$guestOther :number}
>
>when female 0 {{$hostName} does not give a party.}
>when female 1 {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} to her party.}
>when female 2 {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} and one other person to her party.}
>when female * {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} and {$guestsOther} other people to her party.}
>
>when male 0 {{$hostName} does not give a party.}
>when male 1 {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} to his party.}
>when male 2 {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} and one other person to his party.}
>when male * {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} and {$guestsOther} other people to his party.}
>
>when * 0 {{$hostName} does not give a party.}
>when * 1 {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} to their party.}
>when * 2 {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} and one other person to their party.}
>when * * {{$hostName} invites {$guestName} and {$guestsOther} other people to their party.}
>```

## Productions

The specification defines the following grammar productions.

A **_well-formed_** message satisifies all of the rules of the grammar.

A **_valid_** message meets the additional semantic requirements about 
the structure and functionality defined below.

### Message

A **_message_** is a (possibly empty) list of _declarations_ followed by either a single _pattern_,
or a `match` statement followed by one or more _variants_ which represent the translatable body of the message.

A _message_ MUST be delimited with `{` at the start, and `}` at the end. Whitespace MAY
appear outside the delimiters; such whitespace is ignored. No other content is permitted
outside the delimiters.

```abnf
message = [s] *(declaration [s]) body [s]
body = pattern
     / (selectors 1*([s] variant))
```

### Variable Declarations

A **_declaration_** is an expression binding a variable identifier
within the scope of the message to the value of an expression.
This local variable can then be used in other expressions within the same message.

```abnf
declaration = let s variable [s] "=" [s] expression
```

### Selectors

**_Selectors_** are a _match statement_ followed by one or more _variants_.
_Selectors_ provide the ability for a _message_ to use a _pattern_
that varies in content or form depending on values determined at runtime.

A **_selector expression_** is an _expression_ that will be used as part 
of the selection process.

A **_match statement_** indicates that the _message_ contains at least one
_variant_ that can potentially be used to format as output.
A _match statement_ MUST begin with the keyword `match`.
A _match statement_ MUST contain one or more _selector expressions_.
A _match statement_ MUST be followed by at least one _variant_.

```abnf
selectors = match 1*([s] expression)
```

> Examples:
>
> ```
> match {$count :plural}
> when 1 {One apple}
> when * {{$count} apples}
> ```
>
> ```
> let $frac = {$count: number minFractionDigits=2}
> match {$frac}
> when 1 {One apple}
> when * {{$frac} apples}
> ```

### Variants

A **_variant_** is a _pattern_ associated with a set of _keys_.
Each _variant_ MUST begin with the _keyword_ `when`,
be followed by a non-empty sequence of _keys_,
and terminate with a valid _pattern_.
The key `*` is a "catch-all" key, matching all selector values.

```abnf
variant = when 1*(s key) [s] pattern
key     = literal / "*"
```

A _well-formed_ message is considered _valid_ if the following requirements are satisfied:

- The number of keys on each _variant_ MUST be equal to the number of _selectors_.
- At least one _variant's_ keys MUST all be equal to the catch-all key (`*`).
- Each _selector_ MUST have an _annotation_,
  or contain a _variable_ that directly or indirectly references a _declaration_ with an _annotation_.

### Patterns

A **_pattern_** is a sequence of translatable elements.
Patterns MUST be delimited with `{` at the start, and `}` at the end.
A _pattern_'s contents MAY be empty.
Whitespace within a _pattern_ is meaningful and MUST be preserved.
This serves 3 purposes:

- The message can be unambiguously embeddable in various container formats
  regardless of the container's whitespace trimming rules.
  E.g. in Java `.properties` files,
  `hello = {Hello}` will unambiguously define the `Hello` message without the space in front of it.
- The message can be conveniently embeddable in various programming languages
  without the need to escape characters commonly related to strings, e.g. `"` and `'`.
  Such need might still occur when a single or double quote is
  used in the translatable content.
- The syntax needs to make it as clear as possible which parts of the message body
  are translatable and which ones are part of the formatting logic definition.

```abnf
pattern = "{" *(text / expression) "}"
```

> **Example**
> 
> A simple _pattern_ containing _text_:
> ```
> {Hello, world!}
> ```
>
> An empty _pattern_:
> ```
> {}
> ```
>
> Some _patterns_ with _expressions_:
> ```
> {{$foo}}
> {Hello {$user}!}
> {You sent {$count :number maxFractionDigits=0} notifications to {$numFriends :number type=spellout} friends.}
> ```
>
> A _pattern_ containing three spaces:
> ```
> {   }
> ```

### Expressions

An _expression_ can appear as a local variable value, as a _selector_, and within a _pattern_.
The contents of each _expression_ MUST start with an _operand_ or an _annotation_.
An _expression_ MUST NOT be empty.

An **_operand_** is a _literal_ or a _variable_ to be evaluated in an _expression_.
An _operand_ MAY be optionally followed by an _annotation_.

An **_annotation_** consists of a _function_ and its named _options_,
or consists of a _reserved_ sequence.

A **_function_** is functionality used to evaluate, format, select, or otherwise 
process an _operand_, or, if lacking an _operand_, its _annotation_. 

_Functions_ do not accept any positional arguments
other than the _operand_ in front of them.

_Functions_ use one of the following prefix sigils:

- `:` for standalone content
- `+` for starting or opening _expressions_
- `-` for ending or closing _expressions_

```abnf
expression = "{" [s] ((operand [s annotation]) / annotation) [s] "}"
operand = literal / variable
annotation = (function *(s option)) / reserved
option = name [s] "=" [s] (literal / variable)
```

> Expression examples:
>
> ```
> {1.23}
> ```
>
> ```
> {|-1.23|}
> ```
>
> ```
> {1.23 :number maxFractionDigits=1}
> ```
>
> ```
> {|Thu Jan 01 1970 14:37:00 GMT+0100 (CET)| :datetime weekday=long}
> ```
>
> ```
> {|My Brand Name| :linkify href=|foobar.com|}
> ```
>
> ```
> {$when :datetime month=2-digit}
> ```
>
> ```
> {:message id=some_other_message}
> ```
>
> ```
> {+ssml.emphasis level=strong}
> ```
>
> Message examples:
>
> ```
> {This is {+b}bold{-b}.}
> ```
>
> ```
> {{+h1 name=above-and-beyond}Above And Beyond{-h1}}
> ```

#### Private-Use

A **_private-use_** _annotation_ is an _annotation_ whose syntax is reserved
for use by a specific implementation or by private agreement between multiple implementations. 
Implementations MAY define their own meaning and semantics for _private-use_ annotations.

A _private-use_ annotation starts with either U+0026 AMPERSAND `&` or U+005E CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT `^`.
 
Characters, including whitespace, are assigned meaning by the implementation.
The definition of escapes in the `reserved-body` production, used for the body of
a _private-use_ annotation is an affordance to implementations that 
wish to use a syntax exactly like other functions. Specifically:
* The characters `\`, `{`, and `}` MUST be escaped as `\\`, `\{`, and `\}` respectively
when they appear in the body of a _private-use_ annotation. 
* The character `|` is special: it SHOULD be escaped as `\|` in a _private-use_ annotation,
but can appear unescaped as long as it is paired with another `|`. This is an affordance to
allow _literals_ to appear in the private use syntax.

A _private-use_ _annotation_ MAY be empty after its introducing sigil.

**NOTE:** Users are cautioned that _private-use_ sequences cannot be reliably exchanged
and can result in errors during formatting.
It is generally a better idea to use the function registry
to define additional formatting or annotation options.

```abnf
private-use   = private-start reserved-body
private-start = "&" / "^"
```

> Here are some examples of what _private-use_ sequences might look like:
> ```
> {Here's private use with an operand: {$foo &bar}}
> {Here's a placeholder that is entirely private-use: {&anything here}}
> {Here's a private-use function that uses normal function syntax: {$operand ^foo option=|literal|}}
> {The character \| has to be paired or escaped: {&private || |something between| or isolated: \| }}
> {Stop {& "translate 'stop' as a verb" might be a translator instruction or comment }}
> {Protect stuff in {^ph}<a>{^/ph}private use{^ph}</a>{^/ph}}
>```

#### Reserved

A **_reserved_** _annotation_ is an _annotation_ whose syntax is reserved
for future standardization.

A _reserved_ _annotation_ starts with a reserved character.
A _reserved_ _annotation_ MAY be empty or contain arbitrary text after its first character.

This allows maximum flexibility in future standardization,
as future definitions MAY define additional semantics and constraints
on the contents of these _annotations_.
A _reserved_ _annotation_ does not include trailing whitespace.

Implementations MUST NOT assign meaning or semantics to
an _annotation_ starting with `reserved-start`:
these are reserved for future standardization.
Implementations MUST NOT remove or alter the contents of a _reserved_ _annotation_.

While a reserved sequence is technically "well-formed",
unrecognized reserved sequences have no meaning and MAY result in errors during formatting.

```abnf
reserved       = reserved-start reserved-body
reserved-start = "!" / "@" / "#" / "%" / "*" / "<" / ">" / "/" / "?" / "~"

reserved-body  = *( [s] 1*(reserved-char / reserved-escape / quoted))
reserved-char  = %x00-08        ; omit HTAB and LF
               / %x0B-0C        ; omit CR
               / %x0E-19        ; omit SP
               / %x21-5B        ; omit \
               / %x5D-7A        ; omit { | }
               / %x7E-D7FF      ; omit surrogates
               / %xE000-10FFFF
```

## Tokens

The grammar defines the following tokens for the purpose of the lexical analysis.

### Keywords

A **_keyword_** is a reserved token that has a unique meaning in the _message_ syntax.

The following three keywords are reserved: `let`, `match`, and `when`.
Reserved keywords are always lowercase.

```abnf
let   = %x6C.65.74        ; "let"
match = %x6D.61.74.63.68  ; "match"
when  = %x77.68.65.6E     ; "when"
```

### Text

**_text_** is the translatable content of a _pattern_.
Any Unicode code point is allowed,
except for surrogate code points U+D800 through U+DFFF.
The characters `\`, `{`, and `}` MUST be escaped as `\\`, `\{`, and `\}`.

All code points are preserved.

```abnf
text = 1*(text-char / text-escape)
text-char = %x0-5B         ; omit \
          / %x5D-7A        ; omit {
          / %x7C           ; omit }
          / %x7E-D7FF      ; omit surrogates
          / %xE000-10FFFF
```

### Literals

A **_literal_** is a character sequence that appears outside
of _text_ in various parts of a _message_.
A _literal_ can appear in a _declaration_, as a _key_ value,
as an _operand_, or in the value of an _option_.
A _literal_ MAY include any Unicode code point
except for surrogate code points U+D800 through U+DFFF.

All code points are preserved.

A **_quoted_** literal begins and ends with U+005E VERTICAL BAR `|`.
The characters `\` and `|` within a _quoted_ literal MUST be 
escaped as `\\` and `\|`.

An **_unquoted_** literal is a _literal_ that does not require the `|`
quotes around it to be distinct from the rest of the _message_ syntax.
An _unquoted_ MAY be used when the content of the _literal_
contains no whitespace and otherwise matches the `unquoted` production.
Any _unquoted_ literal MAY be _quoted_.
Implementations MUST NOT distinguish between _quoted_ and _unquoted_ literals
that have the same sequence of code points.

_Unquoted_ literals have a much more restricted range that
is intentionally close to the XML's [Nmtoken](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Nmtoken),
with the restriction that it MUST NOT start with `-` or `:`,
as those would conflict with _function_ start characters.

```abnf
literal = quoted / unquoted

quoted         = "|" *(quoted-char / quoted-escape) "|"
quoted-char    = %x0-5B         ; omit \
               / %x5D-7B        ; omit |
               / %x7D-D7FF      ; omit surrogates
               / %xE000-10FFFF

unquoted       = unquoted-start *name-char
unquoted-start = name-start / DIGIT / "."
               / %xB7 / %x300-36F / %x203F-2040
```

### Names

The **_name_** token is used for variable names (prefixed with `$`),
function names (prefixed with `:`, `+` or `-`),
as well as option names.
It is based on XML's [Name](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name),
with the restriction that it MUST NOT start with `:`,
as that would conflict with _function_ start characters.
Otherwise, the set of characters allowed in names is large.

```abnf
variable = "$" name
function = (":" / "+" / "-") name

name = name-start *name-char
name-start = ALPHA / "_"
           / %xC0-D6 / %xD8-F6 / %xF8-2FF
           / %x370-37D / %x37F-1FFF / %x200C-200D
           / %x2070-218F / %x2C00-2FEF / %x3001-D7FF
           / %xF900-FDCF / %xFDF0-FFFD / %x10000-EFFFF
name-char  = name-start / DIGIT / "-" / "." / ":"
           / %xB7 / %x300-36F / %x203F-2040
```

### Escape Sequences

An **_escape sequence_** is a two-character sequence starting with
U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS `\`.

An _escape sequence_ allows the appearance of lexically meaningful characters
in the body of `text`, `quoted`, or `reserved` sequences respectively:

```abnf
text-escape    = backslash ( backslash / "{" / "}" )
quoted-escape  = backslash ( backslash / "|" )
reserve-escape = backslash ( backslash / "{" / "|" / "}" )
backslash      = %x5C ; U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS "\"
```

### Whitespace

**_Whitespace_** is defined as tab, carriage return, line feed, or the space character.

Inside _patterns_ and _quoted literals_,
whitespace is part of the content and is recorded and stored verbatim.
Whitespace is not significant outside translatable text, except where required by the syntax.

```abnf
s = 1*( SP / HTAB / CR / LF )
```

## Complete ABNF

The grammar is formally defined in [`message.abnf`](./message.abnf)
using the ABNF notation,
as specified by [RFC 5234](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234).
