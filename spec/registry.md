# MessageFormat 2.0 Default Function Registry

This section describes the functions for which each implementation MUST provide
a _function handler_ to be conformant with this specification.

Implementations MAY implement additional _functions_ or additional _options_.
In particular, implementations are encouraged to provide feedback on proposed
_options_ and their values.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Stability Policy](/spec#stability-policy) allows for updates to
> Default Registry functions to add support for new options.
> As implementations are permitted to ignore options that they do not support,
> it is possible to write messages using options not defined below
> which currently format with no error, but which could produce errors
> when formatted with a later edition of the Default Registry.
> Therefore, using options not explicitly defined here is NOT RECOMMENDED.

## String Value Selection and Formatting

### The `:string` function

The function `:string` provides string selection and formatting.

#### Operands

The _operand_ of `:string` is either any implementation-defined type
that is a string or for which conversion to a string is supported,
or any _literal_ value.
All other values produce a _Bad Operand_ error.

> For example, in Java, implementations of the `java.lang.CharSequence` interface
> (such as `java.lang.String` or `java.lang.StringBuilder`),
> the type `char`, or the class `java.lang.Character` might be considered
> as the "implementation-defined types".
> Such an implementation might also support other classes via the method `toString()`.
> This might be used to enable selection of a `enum` value by name, for example.
>
> Other programming languages would define string and character sequence types or
> classes according to their local needs, including, where appropriate,
> coercion to string.

#### Options

The function `:string` has no options.

> [!NOTE]
> Proposals for string transformation options or implementation
> experience with user requirements is desired during the Tech Preview.

#### Resolved Value

The _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:string` _function_
contains the string value of the _operand_ of the annotated _expression_,
together with its resolved locale and directionality.
None of the _options_ set on the _expression_ are part of the _resolved value_.

#### Selection

When implementing [`MatchSelectorKeys(resolvedSelector, keys)`](/spec/formatting.md#resolve-preferences)
where `resolvedSelector` is the _resolved value_ of a _selector_
and `keys` is a list of strings,
the `:string` selector function performs as described below.

1. Let `compare` be the string value of `resolvedSelector`
   in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) [\[UAX#15\]](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15)
1. Let `result` be a new empty list of strings.
1. For each string `key` in `keys`:
   1. If `key` and `compare` consist of the same sequence of Unicode code points, then
      1. Append `key` as the last element of the list `result`.
1. Return `result`.

> [!NOTE]
> Unquoted string literals in a _variant_ do not include spaces.
> If users wish to match strings that include whitespace
> (including U+3000 `IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE`)
> to a key, the `key` needs to be quoted.
>
> For example:
> ```
> .input {$string :string}
> .match $string
> | space key | {{Matches the string " space key "}}
> *             {{Matches the string "space key"}}
> ```

#### Formatting

The `:string` function returns the string value of the _resolved value_ of the _operand_.

> [!NOTE]
> The function `:string` does not perform Unicode Normalization of its formatted output.
> Users SHOULD encode _messages_ and their parts in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC)
> unless there is a very good reason not to.

## Numeric Value Selection and Formatting

### The `:number` function

The function `:number` is a selector and formatter for numeric values.

#### Operands

The function `:number` requires a [Number Operand](#number-operands) as its _operand_.

#### Options

Some options do not have default values defined in this specification.
The defaults for these options are implementation-dependent.
In general, the default values for such options depend on the locale, 
the value of other options, or both.

> [!NOTE]
> The names of _options_ and their _values_ were derived from the
> [options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#options)
> in JavaScript's `Intl.NumberFormat`.

The following options and their values are required to be available on the function `:number`:
- `select`
   -  `plural` (default; see [Default Value of `select` Option](#default-value-of-select-option) below)
   -  `ordinal`
   -  `exact`
- `compactDisplay` (this option only has meaning when combined with the option `notation=compact`)
   - `short` (default)
   - `long`
- `notation`
   - `standard` (default)
   - `scientific`
   - `engineering`
   - `compact`
- `numberingSystem`
   - valid [Unicode Number System Identifier](https://cldr-smoke.unicode.org/spec/main/ldml/tr35.html#UnicodeNumberSystemIdentifier)
     (default is locale-specific)
- `signDisplay`
   -  `auto` (default)
   -  `always`
   -  `exceptZero`
   -  `negative`
   -  `never`
- `style`
  - `decimal` (default)
  - `percent` (see [Percent Style](#percent-style) below)
- `useGrouping`
  - `auto` (default)
  - `always`
  - `never`
  - `min2`
- `minimumIntegerDigits`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options), default: `1`)
- `minimumFractionDigits`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options))
- `maximumFractionDigits`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options))
- `minimumSignificantDigits`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options))
- `maximumSignificantDigits`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options))

If the _operand_ of the _expression_ is an implementation-defined type,
such as the _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:number` or `:integer` _annotation_,
it can include option values.
These are included in the resolved option values of the _expression_,
with _options_ on the _expression_ taking priority over any option values of the _operand_.

> For example, the _placeholder_ in this _message_:
> ```
> .input {$n :number notation=scientific minimumFractionDigits=2}
> {{{$n :number minimumFractionDigits=1}}}
> ```
> would be formatted with the resolved options
> `{ notation: 'scientific', minimumFractionDigits: '1' }`.

> [!NOTE]
> The following options and option values are being developed during the Technical Preview
> period.

The following values for the option `style` are _not_ part of the default registry.
Implementations SHOULD avoid creating options that conflict with these, but
are encouraged to track development of these options during Tech Preview:
- `currency`
- `unit`

The following options are _not_ part of the default registry.
Implementations SHOULD avoid creating options that conflict with these, but
are encouraged to track development of these options during Tech Preview:
- `currency`
   - valid [Unicode Currency Identifier](https://cldr-smoke.unicode.org/spec/main/ldml/tr35.html#UnicodeCurrencyIdentifier)
     (no default)
- `currencyDisplay`
   - `symbol` (default)
   - `narrowSymbol`
   - `code`
   - `name`
- `currencySign`
  - `accounting`
  - `standard` (default)
- `unit`
   - (anything not empty)
- `unitDisplay`
   - `long`
   - `short` (default)
   - `narrow`

##### Default Value of `select` Option

The value `plural` is the default for the option `select` 
because it is the most common use case for numeric selection.
It can be used for exact value matches but also allows for the grammatical needs of 
languages using CLDR's plural rules.
This might not be noticeable in the source language (particularly English), 
but can cause problems in target locales that the original developer is not considering.

> For example, a naive developer might use a special message for the value `1` without
> considering a locale's need for a `one` plural:
> ```
> .input {$var :number}
> .match $var
> 1   {{You have one last chance}}
> one {{You have {$var} chance remaining}}
> *   {{You have {$var} chances remaining}}
> ```
>
> The `one` variant is needed by languages such as Polish or Russian.
> Such locales typically also require other keywords such as `two`, `few`, and `many`.

##### Percent Style
When implementing `style=percent`, the numeric value of the _operand_ 
MUST be multiplied by 100 for the purposes of formatting.

> For example,
> ```
> The total was {0.5 :number style=percent}.
> ```
> should format in a manner similar to:
> > The total was 50%.

#### Resolved Value

The _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:number` _function_
contains an implementation-defined numerical value
of the _operand_ of the annotated _expression_,
together with the resolved options' values.

#### Selection

The _function_ `:number` performs selection as described in [Number Selection](#number-selection) below.

### The `:integer` function

The function `:integer` is a selector and formatter for matching or formatting numeric 
values as integers.

#### Operands

The function `:integer` requires a [Number Operand](#number-operands) as its _operand_.

#### Options

Some options do not have default values defined in this specification.
The defaults for these options are implementation-dependent.
In general, the default values for such options depend on the locale, 
the value of other options, or both.

> [!NOTE]
> The names of _options_ and their _values_ were derived from the
> [options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#options)
> in JavaScript's `Intl.NumberFormat`.

The following options and their values are required in the default registry to be available on the 
function `:integer`:
- `select`
   -  `plural` (default)
   -  `ordinal`
   -  `exact`
- `numberingSystem`
   - valid [Unicode Number System Identifier](https://cldr-smoke.unicode.org/spec/main/ldml/tr35.html#UnicodeNumberSystemIdentifier)
     (default is locale-specific)
- `signDisplay`
   -  `auto` (default)
   -  `always`
   -  `exceptZero`
   -  `negative`
   -  `never`
- `style`

  - `min2`
- `minimumIntegerDigits`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options), default: `1`)
- `maximumSignificantDigits`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options))

If the _operand_ of the _expression_ is an implementation-defined type,
such as the _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:number` or `:integer` _annotation_,
it can include option values.
In general, these are included in the resolved option values of the _expression_,
with _options_ on the _expression_ taking priority over any option values of the _operand_.
Option values with the following names are however discarded if included in the _operand_:
- `compactDisplay`
- `notation`
- `minimumFractionDigits`
- `maximumFractionDigits`
- `minimumSignificantDigits`

> [!NOTE]

because it is the most common use case for numeric selection.
It can be used for exact value matches but also allows for the grammatical needs of 
languages using CLDR's plural rules.
This might not be noticeable in the source language (particularly English),

#### Resolved Value

The _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with an `:integer` _function_
contains the implementation-defined integer value
of the _operand_ of the annotated _expression_,
together with the resolved options' values.

#### Selection

The _function_ `:integer` performs selection as described in [Number Selection](#number-selection) below.

### The `:math` function

The function `:math` is a selector and formatter for matching or formatting
numeric values to which a mathematical operation has been applied.

> This function is useful for selection and formatting of values that
> differ from the input value by a specified amount.
> For example, it can be used in a message such as this:
> ```
> .input {$like_count :integer}
> .local $others_count = {$like_count :math subtract=1}
> .match $like_count $others_count
> 0 * {{Your post has no likes.}}
> 1 * {{{$name} liked your post.}}
> * 1 {{{$name} and one other person liked your post.}}
> * * {{{$name} and {$others_count} other people liked your post.}}
> ```

#### Operands

The function `:math` requires a [Number Operand](#number-operands) as its _operand_.

#### Options

The options on `:math` are exclusive with each other,
and exactly one option is always required.
The options do not have default values.

The following options and their values are
required in the default registry to be available on the function `:math`:
- `add`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options))
- `subtract`
  - ([digit size option](#digit-size-options))

If no options or more than one option is set,
or if an _option_ value is not a [digit size option](#digit-size-options),
a _Bad Option_ error is emitted
and a _fallback value_ used as the _resolved value_ of the _expression_.

#### Resolved Value

The _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:math` _function_
contains the implementation-defined numeric value
of the _operand_ of the annotated _expression_.

If the `add` option is set,
the numeric value of the _resolved value_ is formed by incrementing
the numeric value of the _operand_ by the integer value of the digit size option value.

If the `subtract` option is set,
the numeric value of the _resolved value_ is formed by decrementing
the numeric value of the _operand_ by the integer value of the digit size option value.

If the _operand_ of the _expression_ is an implementation-defined numeric type,
such as the _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:number` or `:integer` _annotation_,
it can include option values.
These are included in the resolved option values of the _expression_.
The `:math` _options_ are not included in the resolved option values.

#### Selection

The _function_ `:math` performs selection as described in [Number Selection](#number-selection) below.

### Number Operands

The _operand_ of a number function is either an implementation-defined type or
a literal whose contents match the `number-literal` production in the [ABNF](/spec/message.abnf).
All other values produce a _Bad Operand_ error.

> For example, in Java, any subclass of `java.lang.Number` plus the primitive
> types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, etc.) 
> might be considered as the "implementation-defined numeric types".
> Implementations in other programming languages would define different types
> or classes according to their local needs.

> [!NOTE]
> String values passed as variables in the _formatting context_'s
> _input mapping_ can be formatted as numeric values as long as their
> contents match the `number-literal` production in the [ABNF](/spec/message.abnf).
>
> For example, if the value of the variable `num` were the string
> `-1234.567`, it would behave identically to the local
> variable in this example:
> ```
> .local $example = {|-1234.567| :number}
> {{{$num :number} == {$example}}}
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> Implementations are encouraged to provide support for compound types or data structures
> that provide additional semantic meaning to the formatting of number-like values.
> For example, in ICU4J, the type `com.ibm.icu.util.Measure` can be used to communicate
> a value that includes a unit
> or the type `com.ibm.icu.util.CurrencyAmount` can be used to set the currency and related
> options (such as the number of fraction digits).

### Digit Size Options

Some _options_ of number _functions_ are defined to take a "digit size option".
The _function handlers_ for number _functions_ use these _options_ to control aspects of numeric display
such as the number of fraction, integer, or significant digits.

A "digit size option" is an _option_ value that the _function_ interprets
as a small integer value greater than or equal to zero.
Implementations MAY define an upper limit on the _resolved value_
of a digit size option option consistent with that implementation's practical limits.

In most cases, the value of a digit size option will be a string that
encodes the value as a non-negative integer.
Implementations MAY also accept implementation-defined types as the value.
When provided as a string, the representation of a digit size option matches the following ABNF:
>```abnf
> digit-size-option = "0" / (("1"-"9") [DIGIT])
>```

If the value of a digit size option does not evaluate as a non-negative integer,
or if the value exceeds any implementation-defined upper limit
or any option-specific lower limit, a _Bad Option Error_ is emitted.

### Number Selection

Number selection has three modes:
- `exact` selection matches the operand to explicit numeric keys exactly
- `plural` selection matches the operand to explicit numeric keys exactly
  followed by a plural rule category if there is no explicit match
- `ordinal` selection matches the operand to explicit numeric keys exactly
  followed by an ordinal rule category if there is no explicit match

When implementing [`MatchSelectorKeys(resolvedSelector, keys)`](/spec/formatting.md#resolve-preferences)
where `resolvedSelector` is the _resolved value_ of a _selector_
and `keys` is a list of strings,
numeric selectors perform as described below.

1. Let `exact` be the JSON string representation of the numeric value of `resolvedSelector`.
   (See [Determining Exact Literal Match](#determining-exact-literal-match) for details)
1. Let `keyword` be a string which is the result of [rule selection](#rule-selection) on `resolvedSelector`.
1. Let `resultExact` be a new empty list of strings.
1. Let `resultKeyword` be a new empty list of strings.
1. For each string `key` in `keys`:
   1. If the value of `key` matches the production `number-literal`, then
      1. If `key` and `exact` consist of the same sequence of Unicode code points, then
         1. Append `key` as the last element of the list `resultExact`.
   1. Else if `key` is one of the keywords `zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, or `other`, then
      1. If `key` and `keyword` consist of the same sequence of Unicode code points, then
         1. Append `key` as the last element of the list `resultKeyword`.
   1. Else, emit a _Bad Variant Key_ error.
1. Return a new list whose elements are the concatenation of the elements (in order) of `resultExact` followed by the elements (in order) of `resultKeyword`.

> [!NOTE]
> Implementations are not required to implement this exactly as written.
> However, the observed behavior must be consistent with what is described here.

#### Rule Selection

Rule selection is intended to support the grammatical matching needs of different 
languages/locales in order to support plural or ordinal numeric values.

If the _option_ `select` is set to `exact`, rule-based selection is not used.
Otherwise rule selection matches the _operand_, as modified by function _options_, to exactly one of these keywords:
`zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, or `other`.
The keyword `other` is the default.

> [!NOTE]
> Since valid keys cannot be the empty string in a numeric expression, returning the
> empty string disables keyword selection.

The meaning of the keywords is locale-dependent and implementation-defined.
A _key_ that matches the rule-selected keyword is a stronger match than the fallback key `*`
but a weaker match than any exact match _key_ value.

The rules for a given locale might not produce all of the keywords.
A given _operand_ value might produce different keywords depending on the locale.

Apply the rules to the _resolved value_ of the _operand_ and the relevant function _options_,
and return the resulting keyword.
If no rules match, return `other`.

If the option `select` is set to `plural`, the rules applied to selection SHOULD be 
the CLDR plural rule data of type `cardinal`. 
See [charts](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
for examples.

If the option `select` is set to `ordinal`, the rules applied to selection SHOULD be 
the CLDR plural rule data of type `ordinal`. 
See [charts](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
for examples.

> **Example.**
> In CLDR 44, the Czech (`cs`) plural rule set can be found
> [here](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/44/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#cs).
>
> A message in Czech might be:
> ```
> .input {$numDays :number}
> .match $numDays
> one  {{{$numDays} den}}
> few  {{{$numDays} dny}}
> many {{{$numDays} dne}}
> *    {{{$numDays} dní}}
> ```
> Using the rules found above, the results of various _operand_ values might look like:
> | Operand value | Keyword | Formatted Message |
> |---|---|---|
> | 1 | `one` | 1 den |
> | 2 | `few` | 2 dny |
> | 5 | `other` | 5 dní |
> | 22 | `few` | 22 dny |
> | 27 | `other` | 27 dní |
> | 2.4 | `many` | 2,4 dne |

#### Determining Exact Literal Match

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exact behavior of exact literal match is currently only well defined for non-zero-filled
> integer values.
> Functions that use fraction digits or significant digits might work in specific
> implementation-defined ways.
> Users should avoid depending on these types of keys in message selection in this release.


Number literals in the MessageFormat 2 syntax use the 
[format defined for a JSON number](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-6).
A `resolvedSelector` exactly matches a numeric literal `key`
if, when the numeric value of `resolvedSelector` is serialized using the format for a JSON number,
the two strings are equal.

> [!NOTE]
> The above description of numeric matching contains 
> [open issues](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/issues/675)
> in the Technical Preview, since a given numeric value might be formatted in
> several different ways under RFC8259
> and since the effect of formatting options, such as the number of fraction
> digits or significant digits, is not described.
> The Working Group intends to address these issues before final release
> with a number of design options
> [being considered](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/pull/859).
>
> Users should avoid creating messages that depend on exact matching of non-integer
> numeric values.
> Feedback, including use cases encountered in message authoring, is strongly desired.

## Date and Time Value Formatting

This subsection describes the functions and options for date/time formatting.
Selection based on date and time values is not required in this release.

> [!NOTE]
> Selection based on date/time types is not required by MF2.
> Implementations should use care when defining selectors based on date/time types.
> The types of queries found in implementations such as `java.time.TemporalAccessor`
> are complex and user expectations may be inconsistent with good I18N practices.

### The `:datetime` function

The function `:datetime` is used to format date/time values, including
the ability to compose user-specified combinations of fields.

If no options are specified, this function defaults to the following:
- `{$d :datetime}` is the same as `{$d :datetime dateStyle=medium timeStyle=short}`

> [!NOTE]
> The default formatting behavior of `:datetime` is inconsistent with `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
> in JavaScript and with `{d,date}` in ICU MessageFormat 1.0.
> This is because, unlike those implementations, `:datetime` is distinct from `:date` and `:time`.

#### Operands

The _operand_ of the `:datetime` function is either 
an implementation-defined date/time type
or a _date/time literal value_, as defined in [Date and Time Operand](#date-and-time-operands).
All other _operand_ values produce a _Bad Operand_ error.

#### Options

The `:datetime` function can use either the appropriate _style options_ 
or can use a collection of _field options_ (but not both) to control the formatted 
output.

If both are specified, a _Bad Option_ error MUST be emitted
and a _fallback value_ used as the _resolved value_ of the _expression_.

If the _operand_ of the _expression_ is an implementation-defined date/time type,
it can include _style options_, _field options_, or other option values.
These are included in the resolved option values of the _expression_,
with _options_ on the _expression_ taking priority over any option values of the _operand_.

> [!NOTE]
> The names of _options_ and their _values_ were derived from the
> [options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/resolvedOptions#description)
> in JavaScript's `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.

##### Style Options

The function `:datetime` has these _style options_.
- `dateStyle`
  - `full`
  - `long`
  - `medium`
  - `short`
- `timeStyle`
  - `full`
  - `long`
  - `medium`
  - `short`

##### Field Options

_Field options_ describe which fields to include in the formatted output
and what format to use for that field.

> [!NOTE]
> _Field options_ do not have default values because they are only to be used
> to compose the formatter.

The _field options_ are defined as follows:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The value `2-digit` for some _field options_ **must** be quoted
> in the MessageFormat syntax because it starts with a digit
> but does not match the `number-literal` production in the ABNF.
> ```
> .local $correct = {$someDate :datetime year=|2-digit|}
> .local $syntaxError = {$someDate :datetime year=2-digit}
> ```

The function `:datetime` has the following options:
- `weekday`
  - `long`
  - `short`
  - `narrow`
- `era`
  - `long`
  - `short`
  - `narrow`
- `year`
  - `numeric`
  - `2-digit`
- `month`
  - `numeric`
  - `2-digit`
  - `long`
  - `short`
  - `narrow`
- `day`
  - `numeric`
  - `2-digit`
- `hour`
  - `numeric`
  - `2-digit`
- `minute`
  - `numeric`
  - `2-digit`
- `second`
  - `numeric`
  - `2-digit`
- `fractionalSecondDigits`
  - `1`
  - `2`
  - `3`
- `hourCycle` (default is locale-specific)
  - `h11`
  - `h12`
  - `h23`
  - `h24`
- `timeZoneName`
  - `long`
  - `short`

The following date/time options are **not** part of the default registry.
Implementations SHOULD avoid creating options that conflict with these, but
are encouraged to track development of these options during Tech Preview:
- `calendar` (default is locale-specific)
  - valid [Unicode Calendar Identifier](https://cldr-smoke.unicode.org/spec/main/ldml/tr35.html#UnicodeCalendarIdentifier)
- `numberingSystem` (default is locale-specific)
   - valid [Unicode Number System Identifier](https://cldr-smoke.unicode.org/spec/main/ldml/tr35.html#UnicodeNumberSystemIdentifier)
- `timeZone` (default is system default time zone or UTC)
  - valid identifier per [BCP175](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6557)

#### Resolved Value

The _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:datetime` _function_
contains an implementation-defined date/time value
of the _operand_ of the annotated _expression_,
together with the resolved options values.

### The `:date` function

The function `:date` is used to format the date portion of date/time values.

If no options are specified, this function defaults to the following:
- `{$d :date}` is the same as `{$d :date style=medium}`

#### Operands

The _operand_ of the `:date` function is either 
an implementation-defined date/time type
or a _date/time literal value_, as defined in [Date and Time Operand](#date-and-time-operands).
All other _operand_ values produce a _Bad Operand_ error.

#### Options

The function `:date` has these _options_:
- `style`
  - `full`
  - `long`
  - `medium` (default)
  - `short`

If the _operand_ of the _expression_ is an implementation-defined date/time type,
it can include other option values.
Any _operand_ option values matching the `:datetime` _style options_ or _field options_ are ignored,
as is any `style` option.

#### Resolved Value

The _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:date` _function_
is implementation-defined.

An implementation MAY emit a _Bad Operand_ or _Bad Option_ error (as appropriate)
when a _variable_ annotated directly or indirectly by a `:date` _annotation_
is used as an _operand_ or an _option_ value.

### The `:time` function

The function `:time` is used to format the time portion of date/time values.

If no options are specified, this function defaults to the following:
- `{$t :time}` is the same as `{$t :time style=short}`

#### Operands

The _operand_ of the `:time` function is either 
an implementation-defined date/time type
or a _date/time literal value_, as defined in [Date and Time Operand](#date-and-time-operands).
All other _operand_ values produce a _Bad Operand_ error.

#### Options

The function `:time` has these _options_:
- `style`
  - `full`
  - `long`
  - `medium`
  - `short` (default)

If the _operand_ of the _expression_ is an implementation-defined date/time type,
it can include other option values.
Any _operand_ option values matching the `:datetime` _style options_ or _field options_ are ignored,
as is any `style` option.

#### Resolved Value

The _resolved value_ of an _expression_ with a `:time` _function_
is implementation-defined.

An implementation MAY emit a _Bad Operand_ or _Bad Option_ error (as appropriate)
when a _variable_ annotated directly or indirectly by a `:time` _annotation_
is used as an _operand_ or an _option_ value.

### Date and Time Operands

The _operand_ of a date/time function is either 
an implementation-defined date/time type
or a _date/time literal value_, as defined below.
All other _operand_ values produce a _Bad Operand_ error.

A **_<dfn>date/time literal value</dfn>_** is a non-empty string consisting of an ISO 8601 date,
or an ISO 8601 datetime optionally followed by a timezone offset.
As implementations differ slightly in their parsing of such strings,
ISO 8601 date and datetime values not matching the following regular expression MAY also be supported.
Furthermore, matching this regular expression does not guarantee validity,
given the variable number of days in each month.

```regexp
(?!0000)[0-9]{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])(T([01][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9](\.[0-9]{1,3})?(Z|[+-]((0[0-9]|1[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]|14:00))?)?
```

When the time is not present, implementations SHOULD use `00:00:00` as the time.
When the offset is not present, implementations SHOULD use a floating time type
(such as Java's `java.time.LocalDateTime`) to represent the time value.
