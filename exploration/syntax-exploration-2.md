# Syntax Exploration v2

In the 2023-10-16 teleconference, we narrowed the options being considered for text-mode syntax to "1a", "2a", and "3a" from the [Syntax Variation Beauty Contest](./beauty-contest.md). 
Each of these syntax candidates has been adjusted based on our conversation.

One open issue, separately considered here, is the use of an additional sigil for some of the syntaxes.
We have generally used `#` as the placeholder for this sigil in the previous iteration.

## Candidates

### Candidate 1a

**Description:** Invert for Text Mode, distinguish statements from placeholders

- Placeholders and expressions use `{`/`}`:
  > `{$var}`, `{unquoted}`, `{|quoted|}`, `{$var :function}`
- Non-placeholders use `{#`/`}`:
  > `{#input $user}`, `{#local $var=$foo :expr}`, `{#match {$foo}}`, `{#when * *}`

The use of `#` as the sigil is intentional here.
This sigil might be replaced, but does not require additional escaping, as code is enclosed in `{`/`}`.
Note that the `#` sigil might also be considered to be part of the keyword, e.g. `#when`, `#local` vs.
allowing whitespace to appear between them.

Patterns in this syntax are generally unquoted,
but MAY be quoted with the 2023-10-09 consensus `{{`/`}}` quotes.

ASCII whitespace trimming is assumed, but is a hot topic.

**Examples**
```
Hello world!
```
```
Hello {$user}
```
```
{#input $user :person type=informal}
Hello {$user}

{#input $user :person type=informal}Hello {$user}
```
```
{#input $var :function option=value}
{#local $foo = $bar :function option=value}
Hello {$var}, you have a {$foo}

{#input $var :function option=value}{#local $foo = $bar :function option=value}Hello {$var}, you have a {$foo}
```
```
{#match {$foo}}
{#when foo} Hello {$foo} you have a {$var}
{#when *} {$foo} hello you have a {$var}

{#match {$foo}}{#when foo}Hello {$foo} you have a {$var}{#when *}{$foo} hello you have a {$var}
```
```
{#match {$foo :function option=value} {$bar :function option=value}}
{#when a b} {{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }}
{#when x y} {{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }}
{#when * *} {|  |}{$foo} is {$bar}{|  |}

{#match {$foo :function option=value}{$bar :function option=value}}{#when a b}{{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }}{#when x y}{{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }}{#when * *}{|  |}{$foo} is {$bar}{|  |}
```

### Candidate 2a

**Description**: Text First, Current Syntax for "Complex" Messages

Starts in text mode, but switches to the current "code-mode" syntax for any message containing declarations or selectors.

- "Simple" messages (lacking declarations or selectors) are unquoted patterns.
- Patterns with declarations (`input`, `local`), selectors (`match`/`when`) or both quote all patterns.
- Pattern whitespace is always significant.
  Note that "pattern whitespace" is only that whitespace that appears inside the quoting `{`/`}`
  for quoted patterns.

The use of `{# ... #}` to represent the starting and ending code-mode sigils is **_not_** final.
**_Do not fixate on the specific character sequence when choosing (or not) this design._**

**Examples**
```
Hello world!
```
```
Hello {$user}
```
```
{#
input {$user :function option=value}
{Hello {$user}}
#}

{#input {$user :function option=value}{Hello {$user}}#}
```
```
{#
input {$var :function option=value}
local $foo = {$bar :function option=value}
{Hello {$var}, you have a {$foo}}
#}

{#input {$var :function option=value}local $foo = {$bar :function option=value}{Hello {$var}, you have a {$foo}}#}
```
```
{#
match {$foo}
when foo {Hello {$foo} you have a {$var}}
when * {{$foo} hello you have a {$var}}
#}

{#match {$foo}when foo{Hello {$foo} you have a {$var}}when *{{$foo} hello you have a {$var}}#}
```

```
{#
match {$foo :function option=value} {$bar :function option=value}
when a b {  {$foo} is {$bar}  }
when x y {  {$foo} is {$bar}  }
when * * {  {$foo} is {$bar}  }
#}

{#match {$foo :function option=value}{$bar :function option=value}when a b{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }when x y{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }when * *{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }#}
```

### Candidate 3a

**Description:** Use sigils for code mode

- Starts in text mode. 
- Uses a sigil for code statements. 
  - Requires the code-mode sigil to be escaped in **_unquoted_** patterns.
  - Quoted patterns do not require this sigil to be escaped.
  - Note that decisions about auto-trimming affect the escaping situation. 
    If quoting the pattern is required, no additional escapes are needed.
- Expressions use `{`/`}`:
  > `{$var}`, `{unquoted}`, `{|quoted|}`, `{$var :function}`
  - There is only one expression syntax, which applies to all expressions.
  - Note: placeholders are expressions.
- Variants use a double-sigil `%[` at the start and close the list of `keys`
  with a `]`.
  - The sequence `%[` must be escaped in unquoted patterns.

Patterns in this syntax are generally unquoted,
but MAY be quoted with the 2023-10-09 consensus `{{`/`}}` quotes.

Patterns lacking declarations, selectors, or both, are **_not_** auto-trimmed.
Whitespace in quoted patterns is significant.
Whitespace in unquoted patterns may or may not be significant (hot topic).

```
Hello world!
```
```
Hello {$user}!
```
```
%input {$var :function option=value}
Hello {$var}

%input {$var :function option=value}Hello {$var}
```
```
%input {$var :function option=value}
%local $foo = {$bar :function option=value}
Hello {$var}, you have a {$foo}

%input {$var :function option=value}%local $foo = {$bar :function option=value}Hello {$var}, you have a {$foo}
```
```
%match {$foo}
%[foo] Hello {$foo} you have a {$var}
%[*] {$foo} hello you have a {$var}

%match {$foo}%[foo] Hello {$foo} you have a {$var}%[*] {$foo} hello you have a {$var}
```

```
%match {$foo :function option=value} {$bar :function option=value}
%[a b] {{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }}
%[x y] {||}  {$foo} is {$bar}  {||}
%[* *] {|  |}{$foo} is {$bar}{|  |}

%match {$foo :function option=value} {$bar :function option=value}%[a b] {{  {$foo} is {$bar}  }}%[x y] {||}  {$foo} is {$bar}  {||}%[* *] {|  |}{$foo} is {$bar}{|  |}
```

## Whitespace and Pattern Boundaries

One key consideration for the above options is distinguishing the boundary between 
the end of a _pattern_ and the start of a _variant_ (`when` clause).
This was not an issue in the code-mode syntax because the patterns were always delimited ("quoted").

> [*Note]
> This type of syntax is only needed if patterns are not quoted.
> The "hot debate" in our 2023-10-16 teleconference was between "WYSIWYG"
> no-whitespace-trimming supporters and current WG consensus.
> For current consensus and discussion of whitespace design see [here](pattern-exterior-whitespace.md)

- Candidate 1a uses a double sigil `{#` or distinguishing sequence `{#when` to accomplish this.
- Candidate 2a quotes all patterns in code-mode.
- Candidate 3a uses a sigil sequence `%[` to accomplish this

It is reasonable to think that we might modify this particular part of the syntax
to improve usability. **_Keep in mind the need for single-line authoring._**

For example:

>```
>%match {$foo}
>%%{0} You have no ducks.
>%%{one} You have {$foo} duck.
>%%{*} You have {$foo} ducks.
>
>%match {$foo}
>[[0]] You have no ducks.
>[[one]] You have {$foo} duck.
>[[*]] You have {$foo} duck.
>```

## Sigil Candidates

Some of the above syntaxes require an additional sigil.

Here are the potential sigils that can be used:

| Sigil | Positives | Negatives |
|---|---|---|
| `!` |  | Means "not" in most programming languages. |
| `@` | Feels like code? | Means "address" in a lot of contexts. Might be used for annotations |
| `#` | Feels like code. Similar to `#define`. | Common in real text. Used for _everything_, in particular comments. |
| `%` | Feels like code. Used by some templating languages. | Common in real text. |
| `^` |  | Uncommon choice. Harder to see. |
| `&` |  | Used in a lot of escapes, notably HTML. |
| `+` |  | Looks like an operator. |
| `_` | Feels like code. | Looks like a name prefix. Hard to see. |
| `\|` |  | Already used in our syntax for a diff purpose. Weird. |
| `\` | Feels like code. Already escaped in patterns. | May require escaping (doubling) in host formats. |
| `>` |  | Has meaning in markup. Wants to pair with `<`. |
| `<` |  | Has meaning in markup. Wants to pair with `>`. |
| `?` |  | Looks like `?` operator. Looks like a variable. Very common in real text. |
| `::` |  | Common in real text. Looks like part of a ternary operator. |
| `;` | Can't think of any. | Looks like a statement close. |
| `~` |  | Looks like an operator. |
| `*` |  | Looks like a wildcard. Already used by the syntax. |
| `-` |  | Too common in normal text. |
| `=` |  | Looks like an operator. Already used by the syntax. |
| `[` |  | Enclosing punctuation. |
| `]` |  | Enclosing punctuation. |
| `.` |  | Too common in normal text. Used by other syntaxes |
| `,` |  | Too common in normal text. Not code-like? |
| <code>`</code> |  | Quote mark. |
| `'`  |  | Quote mark. |
| `"` |  | Quote mark. |
