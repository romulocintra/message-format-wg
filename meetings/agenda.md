## Topic: Open/Close function syntax, naming, and immutability.

We have multiple proposals for open/close function markup, including the current scheme (`+function`/`-function`). Let's resolve how to support open/close functionality. These proposal partly exist to address the problem of negative literals, given our use of `-function` currently. 

We have also been discussing whether `let` statements should be immutable. If they are immutable, there is a proposal that they use a different sigil from `$` or that they use a two-character sigil (such as `$$localVar`). Note that separating the sigil allows for static analysis of local variables as called out by #403. This can be a separate concern from whether they are immutable.

| PR   | Description |
|------|-------------|
| #398 | Use `\\open` and `/close` |
| #397 | Use `::open` and `:/close` |
| #399 | Keep `+` and `-`, allow negative literals |

Proposals:

[ ] Make local variables use a different sigil
    [ ] If yes, use one character or two? Which character(s)?
[ ] Make local variables immutable
[ ] Change open and close sigils to avoid `-`?
    [ ] If yes, what sigils or sequences to use?
[ ] Should `name`, etc. use `Nmtoken` or some other rules?

## Topic: Discussion of default registry requirements

An open question is whether MFv2 will provide a **_default_** registry of functions/selectors that implementations are **_required_** to implement.
If such a registry were created, what _should_ go in it (what are the inclusion criteria)?
If we do not create a default registry, how will we prevent divergence of the syntax between implementations?

## Topic: AOB?
