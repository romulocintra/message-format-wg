question if “variables defined externally” are parameters or something else.
EAO: can have variables that are available but are not locally defined; tried not to define the shape of that API; make it possible for impl to choose to make e.g. a ctor and then a second stage to have a formatting function. allowing an implementation. if a local variable has this name then that one, else use the other.

MN: call parameters that and not variables

STA: what you call them depends on what way you look

APP: call parameters that;

EAO: okay with parameters, but don’t want to needlessly limit implementations; they could have globals

MN: keep the difference between parameters and “those extra things”; wouldn’t call them variables. could be context or

MN to make PR

(further discussion)

STA: three things being discussed; what the values area; what if you have two defined separately; what if you have two defined locally–the precedence; think we should solve the two

MN: the local variable; you cannot redefine it; do take precedence over parameters; global variables doesn’t mean they have names; why do we need that

STA: my position was locally defined lets take precedence; if there is a $time and if as a translator I want to decorate with with options I can do “let $time = …” with some options; and there is some change management; if a string changes in the future there is potential

EAO: this is ends up referring to (perhaps in scope of resources) how we track change management

Error discussion PR on agenda for next time

STA: want to talk about function registry on call of 23rd; proposals from last january, the three models each had sections on this
