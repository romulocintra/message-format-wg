# Topic: Closing the book on matching

EAO: thank you MIH for providing a scoring implementation. It made me realize that it requires to be specific about how much one choice is better than another. e.g. A is 4x as good than B. It feels like a setup for weird situations when unrelated selectors can outweigh the decision.

APP: I've considered it. The question is: is there anything in the farther columns that makes the variant jump to the top.

MIH. Are we talking about something like when 1 \* \* … when one one one? Each selectors choose their values.

STA: But are the scores normalized? Also, does \* mean "any" or "any other"?

ECH: I keep alternating between preferring best-match and column-first. Either one will give you the "probably best" match.

STA: For complete messages, all algorithms seem to produce good enough results. Concerned about edge-case related to incomplete messages.

(A discussion about falling back and using one language's plural rules with another language's translations. Suggestion: schedule time for this.)

EAO: We should include incomplete messages as potential use-cases.

SCL: I need to drop for 30 minutes. Will be back. For the record, I'm still in the First Match camp, for cognitive complexity/simplicity reasons, but I fully admit that I've not done my homework on this one.

MIH: Can accept column-first. Against first-match.

STA: What are the benefits of column-first over best-match?

EAO: Feels like magic. …. (please fill in briefly)

APP: It makes people understand how to read the matrix. It helps with tie-breaking.

STA: Do we expect translators to be able to reorder selectors? The manner to break the ties can be grammar-dependent.

EAO: I'd consider this an advantage of column-first.

STA: Initially in first-match camp. Two weeks ago switched, but still not sure which one I prefer. I don't see major blockers in either. However, not a fan of backtracking algorithm.

EAO: Can start with the last column. Will document.

STA: I'm OK continuing with column-first provided we figure out the backtracking problem (if it's a problem; still not sure).

APP: Let's pursue column-first.

# Topic: Markup

APP: Let's start by discussing the reserved prefixes. Proposal: allow exotic prefixes in operand position, but require well-formed "annotation" and "options" after it.

APP: Maybe we don't solve markup in 1.0, but we can reserve prefixes to give us tools to solve in the future.

EAO: Also reserve keywords? Also at least allow new keywords to be added. E.g. "attr" after let, match, when.

EAO: I can do a PR to handle keywords in ABNF.

APP: Will handle reserved prefixes in placeholders.

MIH: I'm fine with well-formed exotic placeholders. Against blob placeholers. Against allowing new keywords.

APP: Are we OK with postponing markup?

MIH: I'd like a discussion.

EAO: I'd strongly like markup in 2.0.

MIH: Why not functions?

STA: Same question. Functions are already flexible + the registry can help with open/close/standalone. On runtime, I imagine markup-specific functions to produce a representation for any markup needed.

ECH: What does having a special syntax for markup give us that we don't have already? On top of that, the comments that I added in issue [#356](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/issues/356) raise the point that directly authoring markup in messages can be problematic for localization, akin to the type of problem of string concatenation in localization that we recognize and don’t want to encourage. So how are we going to answer the questions of these problematic consequences (on top of the question of whether the benefits are worth the costs)?

EAO: When considering non-string output, I want different interfaces for markup and for `{:placeholder}`s.

APP: Can we build something that's agnostic? There's already a notion of things that need to be protected […]

SCL: MF should be non-opinionated. It should not care about whether there is HTML, XML, or anything else.

MIH: Why have markup for open/close, but not for standalone?

STA: EAO, you mentioned the need to address this through interfaces, and that this should be represented upstream. Can you speak to that?

EAO: Regarding the colon markup, what should the markup for `{:foo}` or `{:span}`? I think it should render as like an `<img>`. When you have an inline subportion of a message that needs to be marked up, the open placeholder / tag needs to be paired correctly with the corresponding close placeholder / tag?

STA: EAO and APP, you have said before that we need to be able to determine how markup placeholders match and how to pair them. Maybe we need to specify this, but also look at how we make this fit in XLIFF, and how this works at runtime. We also need to look at how it’s stored. Once we decide that certain placeholders are open or close, then we

ECH: There are other things that will become complicated if we go this route. There are use-cases where we have segmentation happening and a sentence can span multiple segments/messages. An open tag can end up with message1, and the close tag can end up in message3. All of the problems that we are bringing up here all point to needing tooling, in between the source format and the MF messages, both before generating MF messages and after the translation of such messages, in order to clean up the messes caused by these problems. If external tooling is necessary, then it is even less clear why these concerns need to be in MF itself.

EAO: The current language related to markup does not require paired markup.

APP: A few things that I think I'm the outlier about. I'm in the protection business, not evaluation business. E.g. `Hello {+ph}<strong>{-ph}hello`.

STA: What is the next step with these tiny syntaxes? Is there an extra parsing step?

APP: At runtime, this extra protect markup would go away? Or in EAO’s case, when calling formatToParts, the special tags are a signal for handle the inernals in a special way. It would be exactly like the `<ph>` element in XLIFF.

STA: Do you mean something like this: `Hello, {# <strong> #}user!{# </strong> #}`

APP: I’m thinking more like `Hello {+ph}<strong>{-ph}hello`. But the placeholder wouldn’t specify whether it’s HTML or XML or SSML.

ZBI: Could the placeholders also specify the id, and what its paired tag?

APP: Yes, it would have this.

MIH: The syntax that we have today, with placeholders that have a bag of options, can already represent the open/close/standalone information. If we then go and add open/close information to the placeholder, then we have to handle this somehow in the function registry. But with what we already have, we can represent standalone markup tags, ex: `{img :html alt=some text}` is an HTML `<img/>`

APP: 2 points: is HTML special enough that we want to introduce syntax just for it? There is a lot of markup in the world. Are we trying to build a fully generic system, a somewhat generic system, or a targeted system?

ZBI: I want to show this example to see if it aligns with what you’re describing, APP:

```
Hello World!
  {+ph
    type=open
    ns="html"
    id="foo1"
    attr::title="unit2"
  }
    <a>
  {-ph}
  Click me!
  {+ph
    type=close
    ns="html"
    id="foo1"
  }
    </a>
  {-ph}
```

MIH: We need ids on the close `{-ph}` so that they are able to be paired.

ZBI: So is this equivalent?

```
Hello World!
  {+html:a
    type=open
    id="foo1"
    attr::title="unit2"
  }
  Click me!
  {+html:a
    type=close
    id="foo1"
  }
```

MIH: Yes, except, the plus sign sigil means open.

ZBI: How about this:

```
Hello World!
  {+html:a
    id="foo1"
    attr::title="unit2"
  }
  Click me!
  {-html:a
    id="foo1"
  }
```

MIH: More like this:

```
{+a :html
    id="foo1"
    attr::title="unit2"
  }
  Click me!
  {-a html:
    id="foo1"
  }
```

The advantage of this representation is that it matches what we already have in placeholders.

We allow MessageFormat to be independent of knowing whether it will be processed by an HTML or SSML or other type of processor later on for runtime formatting purposes.

STA: Two questions to focus us on the problems: (1) Do we need open/close concepts in the syntax? (2) Do we protect, or protect and evaluate markup?

APP: Need to go back to requirements.

  i think that the open / close concepts are useful
  they exist in xliff, and allows the prevention of certain kind of validation that many l10n tools already do
