## NOTES:

## Schedule and Goals for 2023

Widespread agreement to strive for a separate UTR/UTS.
Aiming for some level of completeness in June for the 16.0 release is an aggressive, but viable target.

## Keywords and normative vocabulary

APP: I’m fine with RFC 2119 terms for normativity, but Mark Davis doesn’t like them. Unicode documents normally embed explicit numbered requirements.

APP: Additionally, our text is probably not sufficiently stable to count on ordering.

RGN: Examples of Unicode style at https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Conformance and https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#11-conformance

EAO: Preference for 2119; Unicode style would be cumbersome at this point but we can always add numbers later.

APP: objections? [none]

EAO: Do we want to style the keywords?

[relatively even split between caps vs. formatting, with many “don’t care” opinions]

### Conclusion

No objection to 2119 keywords. APP to add text adopting them, capitalizing the terms.
For internal terms, bold+italicize on first use and italicize references.

## Function Registry

STA:
[MessageFormat 2: The Function Registry Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z6uEBwMSbW0OmpFGv73usRrk4vo-lgGu6ZNOXjT38a0/edit?usp=sharing)

Mihai: here are some examples from my current proposal as examples https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/main/icu4j/main/tests/core/src/com/ibm/icu/dev/test/message2

APP: On the topic of syntax, I really hope that we don’t have too many variations and dialects of the MF 2 syntax. It would make it much harder to explain to new users.

MIH: On the topic of syntax, I am in the camp of APP that one of the big benefits of having the MF 2 standard is that the result will be interoperable across the industry.

SCL: On the topic of syntax, we should consider the ability for machine translation systems to properly parse MF 2 messages.
