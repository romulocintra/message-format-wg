### Topic: Bring spec description in line with ABNF
- #447

APP: have merge conflicts been resolved?

MIH: No – want to discuss with Eemeli

APP: could you resolve the conflicts?

MIH: Yes

EAO: would find it easier to discuss if it was clear what was being proposed as a change

### Topic: Do not use variable rule outside declaration
- #440

APP: Also has some conflicts - I will put it in the agenda for next week

### Topic: Add details to 'missing selector annotation' section
- #438

APP: Also has some conflicts

TIM: will fix

APP: can also discuss today

### Topic: Replacing '|' with double or single quotes
- #414

EAO: was waiting for me to file some additional text to be explicit about why we're using the pipe instead of something normal

APP: then I assume we're still waiting

### Topic: Replace literal/variable with 'operand' in definition of option
- #412

APP: does anyone object? It would actually be consistent

EAO: I do – this is why I filed #440

APP: You object to it because the usage of 'literal' and 'variable' in that location is not actually an operand?

EAO: Yes, and I think the fundamental issue can be resolved by the change in #440 instead

APP: That's assuming we all agree to that. In one case, we're looking to take and define meaningful production keywords and then use them across the ABNF. In #440, you are removing the variable definition and replacing it with '$' sigil name and getting rid of one of those semantic productions for `variable`. Do we use `variable` somewhere else? In #440 you don't delete the `variable` definition

EAO: We're still using `variable` but only for variable references

APP: Does it make sense to allow you to make `declaration` to be `let` `variable` = `expression`?

EAO: One reason is that this allows for talking about the `name` of a declaration of a thing. Otherwise, a declaration would have a `variable` and an `expression`, which then contains a `variable`, which contains a `name`. Not using `variable` in the declaration rule makes it cleared that the declaration is assigned to a `name`

APP: There was also a discussion about: you're not actually binding a variable, you're binding a value to a name. I find that kind of circular. Why aren't we defining a variable? This is one path, and then reusing `operand` is for a similar reason. I think that's what you're objecting to? If we were going to use a semantic name, it would be `value` or not `operand`.

EAO: Tim what do you think?

TIM: I would have to (re-)read #440

APP: Eemeli, would you be happier with #412 if instead of `operand`, it were `value` and we added another production to the ABNF?

EAO: Yes, except we've discussed that the term `value` specifically is not good. If we were to change to a different name, the word `atom` is better. 

APP: It's kind of pointless to add a semantic production and then have it not mean anything. What would we like to do here? Would we like to keep #412 open and work on naming? Would it be ok if we did away with it for a while, since it doesn't make any actual functional difference?

TIM: ok with abandoning it

APP: so I'm going to close it – I put a comment there so we know why we did that

### Topic: Negative start rule
- #399

APP: Is there any reason why we don't want to at least merge in these changes, so we have negative literals in place? Even though we may come back and change the namespace

EAO: Stas has been blocking this and he's not here. I'm happy to merge this, but it's up to you.

APP: I don't want to go forever without making decisions on these things, but you're right, Stas expressed an opinion and he's not here.

### Topic: Open issues

APP: I propose we go through and close all the open design issues; doesn't inform us about the work that needs to be done. Don't want to be distracted by things that are no longer relevant. Any objection?

### Topic: Design Review: Capabilities for built-in functions
- See #457

Defer because author not here

### Topic: Do not use variable rule outside declaration
- #440

EAO: I just rebased it

APP: do we want to explore that one further today?

### Topic: Hitting our date: getting to done by the end of the year

APP: I started working on a task list to see if we're done and to keep creating issues to track remaining work. Anybody want to say anything else about the schedule?

### Topic: Design Review: Expression Attribute design discussion
- See #458

APP: Eemeli, this is your design doc for expression attributes. Do you want to introduce this?

EAO: It's pretty much what it says on the tin. We've discussed expression attributes a little bit. I added a possible solution as the basis for our discussion. Then the proposal from Stas came in, and a couple days ago I got in a design document for these attributes. After that, Addison and I have had some discussions in there, and I think we've identified 1 or 2 things on which we simply disagree about how these things should work or should be used. I'm interested to hear more comments about these, and if the examples and use cases presented are not sufficient, I'm interested in discovering more reasons/rationales for why this should or shouldn't exist in the spec.

APP: I think the primary thing I'm trying to work through is that we could add just some reserved annotations that every implementation is required to build. `@locale` would obviously be one of them, or the one. But when we open it up and say implementations can create these, or potentially users can plug these in, how do those work, and how do you write functions that can deal with that? One of the conversations that we've had is about how you say that functions have access to those things. If you create an annotation and it should be affecting the formatting somehow, how does the function get it? I don't think we have to say how the function gets it, only that it can get it somehow. The main thing for me is, what's the scope of this? Is it an open box or a closed box that we reserve to ourselves, or somewhere in between?

EAO: I think the difference in what we were talking about is smaller than what we presented in the discussion. I think there are multiple things [...] custom functions… One example you mentioned earlier, the time zone. If we want to see what a message looks like when formatted in a particular time zone– some formatters accept the time zone as a function option, but some don't allow for that, and rather than changing all the date/time formatting calls everywhere to refer to an explicit time zone, we could override it for a specific expression… but that one, we could do as a function option. But let's suppose we want to do that for some reason. What I could imagine happening is that the time zone expression attribute is considered as the system time zone by the date/time formatting function that's being used internally. The specific difference in what I'm saying is that we should make it so that an implementation could extend what they consider to be the formatting context to include a thing like the time zone. An expression attribute could then override the value. Should be done by some slightly different implementation-defined means, rather than just the function looking around to see "does my expression include a time zone?", not as a function option but as an expression attribute. Do you see the difference here?

APP: I see the difference. When you override something with an expression attribute, you're effectively setting an environment variable, or something contextual, not passed as an argument. Some will never be read. An `@tz` would set the apparent default time zone when the datetime function is created. Presumably, you could still pass in an option that can override it. A different example might be more powerful. All our systems have this as a contextual variable, the "store", and it's occasionally valuable to override what the "store" is in a context, like when writing a demo. That would be an implementation-specific contextual value, which you might want to override. The function expects it to come out of the context, not as an option. That might be an example of something similar. But my main thing is, if we build one of these things, how do functions find out about them? Maybe, whatever expression you provide, it just sets whatever it sets, and the function finds out however it finds out. Doesn't say what the shape of the formatting context is

EAO: To take the store example, I can imagine specifying an override for a very specific value at some path within the store. The value that's available during formatting is not at all this expression attribute. Would be the overall value of the store. Up to the implementation to figure out that this attribute means that we modify the store a little bit for this particular call

APP: Or, modify the environment that that function is called in

MIH: What Eemeli describes seems very familiar. What Andre (?) described is having a context object that carries that. Why have it in MessageFormat 2? I can modify 1 or 2 things in the application context and use it. Why do we need a special syntax?

APP: The primary example Eemeli provided is @locale, where we want to change one expression in the message to use a different locale. To use the store example, US dollar formats differently in the US store vs. the Canadian store. That's not locale-based. 

MIH: I totally agree with that use case. I wouldn't drag in the whole environment/context in it and look at this stuff as overrides for that. I would kind of like to leave that out and say, this is a generic attribute and functions get a bag of options that are per-placeholder, not function attributes. If you want to call it an environment, fine, but I wouldn't want to mix it with something else and define standard names and rules for overriding. I would look at it as an implementation detail. That way I'm not forced to standardize names across machineries.

EAO: I don't know if you've, Mihai, had a chance to look at the design doc, but the possible use cases that I list there – one of them, as Addison mentioned, is setting the locale or locale chain for a specific expression. Second one is setting the direction used for that expression and a third one is defining a fallback value to use. Then for the other possible things that don't affect formatting, there's at least an example to provide translators with, and then there was a boolean flag for translating [...]. Can-copy, can-delete as examples of things to consider. That's what I have in mind for a mechanism like this to be serving. What I understand Addison wants to make sure is that whatever we come up with, it supports things like a context or store. The difference we end up at is how to delicately expression whether a custom function can get direct access to a custom attribute or whether it needs to go through further processing.

APP: Here we are in the design doc, we should decide what the scope of things is. Mihai, to your point, I don't think we're creating a separate context. Talking about providing a way for the implementation to write to the `context` thing in whatever environment where it's hosted. Will it be widely used? I don't think so, but you could extend it. Or we could just say that these are the ones and there shall be no others.

MIH: I think the spec should say something like "we anticipate this will grow in the future". I wouldn't put a list of 3 things and say 'this is it', so that parsers don't hardcode those 3 things.

APP: This is similar to sigils. There's "reserved for future standardization"; a different kind is "available now, any implementation can do whatever it wants within these rules". I think we should decide. The conservative thing would be saying, "we provide these expression annotations, there shall be no others." The things we haven't been talking about here, Eemeli's brought up some of the XLIFF things, which seem important to me as a mechanism for communicating to translators. I don't know if XLIFF provides the right things or if we've fully baked the right list at this second. Those are not runtime-affecting annotations and so we might define something or provide a namespace for non-runtime-affecting "communicate to your translation tools" kinds of annotations.

MIH: For me the XLIFF stuff that's not runtime, I would see as a different mechanism. What I would expect in this one is open and close. These are attributes of the placeholder, in my opinion. I understand that they can be pretty long. We can consider something with @+ and @- iif we massage the names properly to say what's coming after '@'. I don't disagree with that. I think this was started by Stas to handle open/close. An identifier would be useful, I think. Even without the '=' part. That, or even that [see below]

 I did read the PR before it became a design doc. Haven't read the design doc yet. I might be a bit dated.

EAO: To clarify the origins of this particular story of expression attributes, they actually started from the @locale or the discussion on how toi define the locale for an expression. There's an issue for that that I filed, which turned into this PR. We've also discussed something like what expression attributes are turning into, as a way to communicate open- and closeness. But to be clear, that's not something I think should be supported by message attributes. More properly function options. To be honest, the open and close are significant in a different way and have separate reasons to exist. I think, Mihai, if you think the scope of expression attributes should be extended to also cover something like open/closeness, could you comment and suggest language to include in the design doc on this? Or should it be discussed separately?

MIH: I can comment and propose changes to the design doc, because for me, open/close are properties of the placeholder, not of the function.

APP: I'll make a couple proposals. One is, I'm going to propose that we merge the design doc and then discuss it in the form of either PRs or issues. Then we'll have a document we can pull up and read and say if these requirements are accurate. Second, Mihai, if I'm channeling what you're saying correctly, the reason IDs are important in XLIFF is to associate two expressions with each other, so that you can say "here's the first one, here's the other one that goes with it", and when you move things around, translation tools have the keys necessary to keep things in the proper order.

MIH: It's true, it's also used for cross-references. If you have an <img> tag, and it might have an alt and a title etc., you want to represent a reference to that id. They have a bit more uses than just open/close.

APP: My observation is, I like the idea of allowing annotation to do this kind of thing, but we should study what we want it to be and I think that discussion has to go with the discussion of open/close. If we decide that +/- sigils go with… that would influence the syntax we would provide. Maybe an annotation turns out not to be the thing we want to do

EAO: When you say by merging the design doc, you mean merging it after we've achieved consensus around it? Or merging it and then being open to iterating on its contents?

APP: Here is a design doc, commit it to the repo, its status is not yet "approved", but it is – here's the doc and as we iterate against it we can do PRs to change specific things. Enough consensus exists that this is the design doc. We can then go in and talk about details, rather than trying to do it all with diff.

MIH: I would say – can you please give me a day or two to read it? I read the PR before it was a design doc. I don't know exactly what changed. I'm a bit reluctant to say 'just commit it.'

APP: The difference is that it's a separate doc. Not a pull request to the spec, it's separate. We can consider merging it next week if you've read it

MIH: It feels a bit wrong to say "sure, merge it" without even reading it

EAO: What you mentioned earlier is a meta-level point that probably needs an issue and change to the template. You referred to the "status" as not being approved. This isn't a current field. We need 1, 2 or stages for this. Maybe "approved" yes/no to start with. Or "proposed" and "accepted". Then we could merge this as a proposed design doc, iterate on its shape, and as another step we change its status to 'accepted', so multiple PRs could exist on the same design doc at the same time. Does this sound like a good idea?

(everyone:) yes

EAO: I think if we're going this way, it's going to slow down the rate of change at which we can apply things to the spec, and recognize that we're limiting our capability to change the spec. OTOH it gives us a way to have things progress, which could speed things up.

APP: We'll have to use it judiciously, and we don't use a design doc for everything we do. But we've had a useful discussion out of this doc and it should make writing the actual PR efficient

EAO: the current PR is already proposing the thing. One thing that does come to mind is, is someone writing a design doc proposing a different solution than our current one for open/close? If someone wants to apply a change to existing text, it would be high time to get started

MIH: Stas started something there, I don't know if it's a design doc yet. I was hoping he would go that way

APP: He and I were working on a doc together. Then he came up with the design proposal thing, we haven't gone back and made that out of it. I agree that we seem to have everything tied up in a knot in this – kind of all the key things about open/close, functions, sigils. If we change something, it needs to take the form of a design doc proposal that says "here's what we propose to change". Otherwise, what we have is what goes, because that's the consensus we have. I think that would be the correct next step for that, and I suspect that will be the core topic of conversation – the sigil/namespace/formatting thing – that we do in Seville. I think if we unblock that, the line to "done" is a highway, not a bunch of cross-country exploration. I think. 

EAO: The other thing, which I think we ought to have besides a design doc, is how to handle variable references and that whole space. I tried that once, but could not get us to find consensus, so I stepped back out. There, what we have in the spec has too much undefined behavior, whereas for the open/close I'm actually OK with the compromise that we ended up at. To put this out there that these are two things where if we want to change the spec, someone should be doing something about it, and the person for either of those things isn't me.

APP: Anything else we want to do on this topic today? Do you want an action to go work on that, or do we want to leave that out of scope? Can we just leave the variable referencing out of scope for 2.0?

EAO: that's what we effectively end up doing if we don't find a compromise/consensus for how to handle it. I'm ok with what the spec is saying, but someone else might read it differently.

MIH: The current form of the syntax doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that it's somewhat underspecified and I'm afraid different impls might treat it differently

APP: When we do the function registry stuff and do more work in the formatting spec – when we don't say anything, when we go later down the track, we find out we haven't specified this and it's hard to say what it means.

MIH: Exactly. If we leave it as is, we leave all the heavy lifting to the function registry. We have to say we register an "open bold" and a "close bold" and these are different functions. It changes the whole meaning in a way. If we leave them fuzzy, I think it's risky. Not the syntax that bothers me, it's what they mean

APP: Are there any actions we can take here? 

### Topic: Allowing expressions without annotations to dynamically choose a function
- #456

A key issue here is whether we need to require annotations on all functions or on any function that does something other than “toString” type formatting. See the discussion in this issue for the implications.

APP: Today we allow you to have an expression containing only an operand. This PR would make it explicit that an implementation may, but is not required to, look at the value of the operand and decide what formatter to use, other than the literal (string) formatter. My call-out is that for example, MF1 does this through reflection, today in ICU. It saves keystrokes for people using reasonably typed languages. Should we allow this, or prohibit it explicitly and say that if you want anything other than placing the value literally, you need to provide the annotation to say what function to use? 

EAO: Could you clarify exactly how ICU MF1 allows, in its syntax, for literal values? I don't think that's possible

APP: You mean – it doesn't have a syntax for assigning values inside of the pattern. But it does accept operands, variables, and those variables all have a type, and it uses the type to choose the formatter

EAO: We do that in MF2 for variable references, but you're talking about literals, not variable references, here?

APP: I'm talking about expressions without annotations, so it could be a variable reference like $foo. If $foo is a number, this would allow the formatter to choose the `number` formatter. The logical conclusion is that all of our declarations use literals; therefore the literals could be interpreted to be a number or date or something like that by an implementation, should it choose to do it. This is all "may". Important because it seems weird to me to be able to pass a value as, let's say, an integer, and not to be able to declare one with an integer value.

MIH: My reading until this proposal is that string literals without a function would be rendered as-is. Doesn't matter whether they come with a different variable or not. No smarts anywhere to associate a function with that. The function association is based on type, not value. What ICU4C does is wrap the argument in something they call a "Formattable", which is a "poor man's" runtime type info. But it's still on the type, not on the value. No one is looking to say "2012/09/01" looks like a date, let's call a date formatter on it.

APP: I hear that, but the challenge is that we don't have types, or typing. Again, for all of our things are literals, they're allowed to be interpreted as a value by parsing it, in the function, but then you have to force the function in order to make – if you do a declaration. The other thing is, the source of this PR is actually – you don't get a number formatter unless you say – for a number value that's passed in, let's say I pass an int in my arg array for MF2, you never get a number formatter unless you say `:number`. So if we're going to make that choice, it feels a little surprising when you have a strongly typed language when you can't figure it out like MF1 did, but then we need to explicitly say outright "thou shalt not do that"

MIH: but MF1 didn't have string literals

APP: but the values are typed and it did reflection. We need to permit that if we intend that to work. If we don't say that it's permitted, then it's forbidden, and we need to say so.

MIH: It's permitted, but will be rendered as-is. Use case is for things intended to be non-translatable. PL keywords, application version numbers. Otherwise, you need to invent some other mechanism to protect them from translators. "123" with nothing, it will be rendered literally. "123 :number" will be rendered as a number.

EAO: [...] Can resolve to certain values and then format these to some specific sorts of shapes. One includes concatenated strings, but at no point do we say that if you resolve a number to an int.. what are you supposed to do with it? How does this int turn into a string? So I would push back a little on what Addison said, I would rather say that if we don't define it, it's up to an implementation to figure it out. Allows for a number formatter to be applied to a number value.

APP: What I think we have to say is what is permitted or not permitted, such that people can write tests for their implementation. If we say you're required to provide an annotation to get anything other than the string format, that's one thing. If we say an implementation may look at the value, that's another thing. We can split the difference and say literals are always strings unless an annotation is provided, but variables can be interpreted. We can say that, but we need to say what's permitted so developers know what they have to do to get the right behavior. What I'm afraid of is, my integer looks fine if it's passed as a variable, but if I declare it as a literal, it suddenly turns into a string

EAO: If you want to locally define a number, you can: let foo = {|12345| :number}. If you're using a reasonable implementation, it will convert that to a number. 

APP: You require an annotation –

MIH: The annotation is there, yes. 

EAO: I agree with Mihai that non-string literal values don't exist. But with an annotation, you can turn a literal string into a number, or a Formattable, or whatever the representation is and get the behavior you're looking for.

APP: Does anyone disagree?

```

APP: What about the other part of my PR? What if I don't have a declaration, just a variable; is an implementation allowed to reflect that variable to determine its type, in order to apply the formatter?

EAO: Are you asking whether $foo would be the number like 12345, or the string "12345"?

APP: I call my message formatter and I have my name $foo, and my value which is an Integer object 12345, and I pass it in and have {$foo}. Should we permit Java to treat the value as a number?

MIH: In my reading, yes. MessageFormat does it. Mark Davis expressed strong opinions that he really wants that, when I tried to suggest always having a function. He said no, you have to support that. But that's a type, and it's available at runtime. It's a type, and the current implementation of MessageFormat supports that today. At runtime, I can register new types. I can say "for this type, use this function". 

EAO: In brief, yes, an impl may define "how does it turn a value that's in a different shape from its formatting target to match its formatting target"

APP: Can you clarify?

EAO: We're talking as if strings are what we are formatting to. This is a common case but not the case. Sometimes we will want to format to parts or to some entirely different structure. I'm saying an implementation may, in that situation, define the mapping from its inputs to outputs. 

APP: That's a level of abstraction further than I'd taken it, but fair enough. What I'm hoping to be able to say is that effectively, if I pass a value, an implementation may but is not required to choose to annotate that value with a function, not a literal, but a value, an external variable, can be annotated according to the implementation's desire. From there, processing can proceed as you describe. For example, if I pass a number, then formatToParts will produce number-y parts for numbers. If I pass a date, it will produce date-y parts for a date, without my having to annotate that. For an implementation that supports it, that is strongly typed enough to do that.

EAO: Yes, that is one way of solving it. It is not and cannot be a required way for us to say that this must be solved. What I mean by that is that we have three stages we're currently defining: resolution, pattern selection, and formatting? We're talking about the ultimate result of all of this. If we're virtually applying annotations, we're talking about applying a change at the resolution stage. It would be conceivable for an impl to choose to do this in its formatting stage.

APP: Because you think resolution does not include defining what the type is, just figuring out what to call?

EAO: I think that's an implementation-dependent matter that doesn't have external visibility, so we shouldn't mandate something on that. The way in which this does have an appearance is that we have specific categories of errors – selection errors and formatting errors – if an error happens during this process, we have to be careful about whether we say this should be a selection error or formatting error, because that gives external visibility to what's currently an internal matter

APP: Selectors, we've already required you name the annotation. So we can get a type mismatch that would occur if you declare something as a plural selector and don't give it a number. I think that takes care of itself. I'm trying to do a "may" here, not a requirement. What I'm trying to do is say that the assignment of the annotation, whether we want to say that takes place in resolution or formatting, can depend on the value – may depend on the value, not required to. Is that a good thing? Is that what we want it to do?

EAO: Let's say that a formatter supports date values and has them as dates but doesn't explicitly have a datetime annotation. Then if we require that assignment of an annotation, we say a formatter like this isn't valid, that it must provide a datetime annotation

APP: I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that if a MessageFormat impl has some registry of functions, ti may choose to match some typed value to one of those functions without having to annotate it to say that. If you pass me any kind of Number object in Java, I can match that to the number formatter without annotating it. I may do that and would be compliant, as opposed to "you didn't tell me the annotation, I'm going to make it a string"

EAO: My concern is with the specific wording. I posit that implementations will want to support a specific formatting without making it available as an explicit annotation. Will your language rule that out?

APP: Do you have an example?

EAO: Date/times. Let's say my impl does not provide a :date or :time: or :datetime. Am I allowed, with this formatter, to be able to support a date object as an input value and apply a toString to it or do whatever I want when producing output?

APP: It says "may" – you can map objects to whatever formatter you want. No requirement that you do so. I don't think your example would be permitted to be a valid MF2 impl because we require date/time. Let's say you have a PersonName and no person formatter. You could assign that Person object to string, or a number formatter. That would be your implementation choice, that's up to you. Probably people would complain if you did that, but that would be your implementation choice, not – we wouldn't require that you assign it to a specific thing.

EAO: So the language you're proposing doesn't refer to assigning annotations, but rather behavior to resolved values?

APP: No, I think it – because it can only be for a placeholder, because selectors are required to have annotation, what I'm saying is that for a placeholder with no annotation, the implementation may choose the annotation and the options, and then everything after that proceeds as if the person had typed it in that way. As opposed to requiring that we plumb this everywhere through all the text, if that makes sense.

MIH: I want to see if what I'm saying is acceptable to how Eemeli sees stuff. Let's say PersonName. Nothing in the standard registry to format person names. I have a data type called a Person and I pass it to MessageFormat. What happens? In some PLs it's something like foo.toString(). But if you want a certain behavior, you can either say we allow a certain behavior without making it a named function. It won't have a name I can use in other places. But why not have a custom registry? I can have a proprietary Google.PersonName function, put it in the registry, say what parameters it takes, and associate my PersonName with that formatter. It's a real annotation and I don't have to assume some behavior happens without an annotation. Is that too much of a burden, to have to define a custom registry?

EAO: Basically, yes, it is. In particular, it requires explicit naming to be available for every possible formatter, for every single possible datatype that can go through MF2. It's a huge burden and is completely unnecessary.

APP: Is that true? 

EAO: Take the PersonName example. Let's say I have an existing system where we're using MF2. We have PersonName objects going through it. Let's say they have a toString() formatter on it that produces a string repr of this person object. In order to be able to use this in an MF2 impl, can I just have it work? Or do I need to create a custom function registry where i have this Person handler telling me I can explicitly do this thing I'm doing implicitly?

APP: I think what you're saying is permitted. I think what Mihai is saying is, suppose I create a PersonName formatter function in my registry; it would be permitted for an impl to allow that function to register itself as "I am a formatter for Person objects", and if you hand me a com.google.personobject, I will format it for you, and it could even be registered as the default handler – if I didn't have that function, I would call Person.toLocaleString(), but since I have one registered as a handler, I'm permitted to align that function with that object. So you can make it work without having to annotate with :person – it just works. That message would stop working on an impl that didn't have that function registered, or it would fall back to using the toLocaleString() or toString() method.

MIH: One option would be to register a function name / annotation name for generic toString stuff. I think formatting just to string is a dangerous thing. toString() is in general used for debugging and you might leak stuff you don't want to leak – session IDs or all kinds of keys. If you register a proper function for PersonName, that's great. Otherwise, you might see my Social Security number, date of birth, etc.

EAO: Continuing with the com.google.person structure, I want to be sure I can register [...] the specific custom behavior to use with the com.google.person object, without making :person an explicit thing that can be included in the syntax. Am I required to ensure that that name exists?

APP: I don't know. Maybe. I think that's a separate discussion we probably need to have. I suspect that on some level, we have to describe in the function registry what an invisible formatter is. Point of order: we're 11 minutes past time and I do want to also talk about whether we have a meeting next week, or any more meetings before we see people in Seville. Jumping back to topic, I think I've heard enough to make changes to my PR so it reflects the consensus we have about literals and declarations and maybe to make good progress on this part, the allowance for implementations to assign formatters internally. 

EAO: As long as that behavior does not link back to making it an annotation, but is describing that an impl may define custom behavior for how to format values that are part of the result. That would satisfy my concerns and not impose undue restriction on implementations.

APP: Let me make sure it's clear – you want to allow implementations to apply any kind of formatting, even if it's not listed in the function registry, to objects?

EAO: Yes – I think that needs to be implementation-defined behavior, as we can't assume all formatting will be to strings. For formatToParts we want to allow values to fall through or define custom behavior.

MIH: The current ICU implementation, for instance, requires a function with that name to be registered in the function registry. It doesn't require you to use it in the MessageFormat. I can say $person and that will be formatted as a person. If I have a function registered called "whatever" and a mapping from that type to the function… but the function is not invisible. I can't register a function without a name. Not saying this is the right thing or not, just saying it's the current implementation. Mapping is from a native data type to a name, and the name is used to look up in a function table. Everything in the table maps from a string (function name) to a function implementation. You can do "hello personName" and it will be formatted as a person if I register it. I have to have a name and there's no visibility restriction on the name.

APP: Let me make sure I'm understanding Eemeli correctly. The implementation is allowed to look at a type and can apply whatever processing it wants, assuming there's no annotation to tell it otherwise. If I pass a Thing object, then an implementation could say "I know about Things and I'm going to apply magic internal foo to it to create the parts that are the output."

EAO: Yes, with the further restriction that this applies to things with annotation. Consider {12345: number}. Let's say the impl resolves this to a FormatterNumber object. I believe it's an implementation detail for the impl to take that object and turn it into whatever the target is, as a string or in FormatToParts

APP: We don't say anything beyond that, just that you have to have a number formatter, not what the output shape is.
Topic: AOB?
US holiday for 4 September (Labor Day): should we meet?

APP: if we don't meet, we'll be at TPAC together for the next meeting. could have an abbreviated meeting to prep.

APP: we're having a call and will limit scope to prepping to see each other
